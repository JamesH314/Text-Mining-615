33111 "Morgan was the first to make an attempt at introducing a logical order"
33111 "into the history of primeval society. Until considerably more material"
33111 "is obtained, no further changes will be necessary and his arrangement"
33111 "will surely remain in force."
33111 ""
33111 "Of the three main epochs--savagery, barbarism and"
33111 "civilization--naturally only the first two and the transition to the"
33111 "third required his attention. He subdivided each of these into a lower,"
33111 "middle and higher stage, according to the progress in the production of"
33111 "the means of sustenance. His reason for doing so is that the degree of"
33111 "human supremacy over nature is conditioned on the ability to produce the"
33111 "necessities of life. For of all living beings, man alone has acquired an"
33111 "almost unlimited control over food production. All great epochs of human"
33111 "progress, according to Morgan, coincide more or less directly with times"
33111 "of greater abundance in the means that sustain life. The evolution of"
33111 "the family proceeds in the same measure without, however, offering"
33111 "equally convenient marks for sub-division."
33111 ""
33111 ""
33111 "I. SAVAGERY."
33111 ""
33111 "1. Lower Stage. Infancy of the human race. Human beings still dwelt in"
33111 "their original habitation, in tropical or subtropical forests. They"
33111 "lived at least part of the time in trees, for only in this way they"
33111 "could escape the attacks of large beasts of prey and survive. Fruit,"
33111 "nuts, and roots served as food. The formation of articulated speech is"
33111 "the principal result of this period. Not a single one of all the nations"
33111 "that have become known in historic times dates back to this primeval"
33111 "stage."
33111 ""
33111 "Although the latter may extend over thousands of years, we have no means"
33111 "of proving its existence by direct evidence. But once the descent of man"
33111 "from the Animal Kingdom is acknowledged, the acceptance of this stage of"
33111 "transition becomes inevitable."
33111 ""
33111 "2. Middle Stage: Commencing with the utilization of fish (including"
33111 "crabs, mollusks and other aquatic animals) and the use of fire. Both"
33111 "these things belong together, because fish becomes thoroughly palatable"
33111 "by the help of fire only. With this new kind of food, human beings"
33111 "became completely independent of climate and locality. Following the"
33111 "course of rivers and coastlines, they could spread over the greater part"
33111 "of the earth even in the savage state. The so-called palaeolithic"
33111 "implements of the early stone age, made of rough, unsharpened stones,"
33111 "belong almost entirely to this period. Their wide distribution over all"
33111 "the continents testifies to the extent of these wanderings. The"
33111 "unceasing bent for discovery, together with the possession of fire"
33111 "gained by friction, created new products in the lately occupied regions."
33111 "Such were farinaceous roots and tubers, baked in hot ashes or in baking"
33111 "pits (ground ovens). When the first weapons, club and spear, were"
33111 "invented, venison was occasionally added to the bill of fare. Nations"
33111 "subsisting exclusively by hunting, such as we sometimes find mentioned"
33111 "in books, have never existed; for the proceeds of hunting are too"
33111 "uncertain. In consequence of continued precariousness of the sources of"
33111 "sustenance, cannibalism seems to arise at this stage. It continues in"
33111 "force for a long while. Even in our day, Australians and Polynesians"
33111 "still remain in this middle stage of savagery."
33111 ""
33111 "3. Higher Stage: Coming with the invention of bow and arrow, this stage"
33111 "makes venison a regular part of daily fare and hunting a normal"
33111 "occupation. Bow, arrow and cord represent a rather complicated"
33111 "instrument, the invention of which presupposes a long and accumulated"
33111 "experience and increased mental ability; incidentally they are"
33111 "conditioned on the acquaintance with a number of other inventions."
33111 ""
33111 "In comparing the nations that are familiar with the use of bow and"
33111 "arrow, but not yet with the art of pottery (from which Morgan dates the"
33111 "transition to barbarism), we find among them the beginnings of village"
33111 "settlements, a control of food production, wooden vessels and utensils,"
33111 "weaving of bast fibre by hand (without a loom), baskets made of bast or"
33111 "reeds, and sharpened (neolithic) stone implements. Generally fire and"
33111 "the stone ax have also furnished the dugout and, here and there, timbers"
33111 "and boards for house-building. All these improvements are found, e. g.,"
33111 "among the American Indians of the Northwest, who use bow and arrows, but"
33111 "know nothing as yet about pottery. Bow and arrows were for the stage of"
33111 "savagery what the iron sword was for barbarism and the fire-arm for"
33111 "civilization; the weapon of supremacy."
33111 ""
33111 ""
33111 "II. BARBARISM."
33111 ""
33111 "1. Lower Stage. Dates from the introduction of the art of pottery. The"
33111 "latter is traceable in many cases, and probably attributable in all"
33111 "cases, to the custom of covering wooden or plaited vessels with clay in"
33111 "order to render them fire-proof. It did not take long to find out that"
33111 "moulded clay served the same purpose without a lining of other material."
33111 ""
33111 "Hitherto we could consider the course of evolution as being equally"
33111 "characteristic, in a general way, for all the nations of a certain"
33111 "period, without reference to locality. But with the beginning of"
33111 "barbarism, we reach a stage where the difference in the natural"
33111 "resources of the two great bodies of land makes itself felt. The salient"
33111 "features of this stage of barbarism is the taming and raising of animals"
33111 "and the cultivation of plants. Now the eastern body of land, the"
33111 "so-called old world, contained nearly all the tamable animals and all"
33111 "the cultivable species of grain but one; while the western continent,"
33111 "America, possessed only one tamable mammal, the llama (even this only in"
33111 "a certain part of the South), and only one, although the best, species"
33111 "of grain: the corn. From now on, these different conditions of nature"
33111 "lead the population of each hemisphere along divergent roads, and the"
33111 "landmarks on the boundaries of the various stages differ in both cases."
33111 ""
33111 "2. Middle Stage. Commencing in the East with the domestication of"
33111 "animals, in the West with the cultivation and irrigation of foodplants;"
33111 "also with the use of adobes (bricks baked in the sun) and stones for"
33111 "buildings."
33111 ""
33111 "We begin in the West, because there this stage was never outgrown up to"
33111 "the time of the conquest by Europeans."
33111 ""
33111 "At the time of their discovery, the Indians in the lower stage of"
33111 "barbarism (all those living east of the Mississippi) carried on"
33111 "cultivation on a small scale in gardens. Corn, and perhaps also"
33111 "pumpkins, melons and other garden truck were raised. A very essential"
33111 "part of their sustenance was produced in this manner. They lived in"
33111 "wooden houses, in fortified villages. The tribes of the Northwest,"
33111 "especially those of the region along the Columbia river, were still in"
33111 "the higher stage of savagery, ignorant of pottery and of any cultivation"
33111 "of plants whatever. But the so-called Pueblo Indians in New Mexico, the"
33111 "Mexicans, Central-Americans and Peruvians, were in the middle-stage of"
33111 "barbarism. They lived in fortlike houses of adobe or stone, cultivated"
33111 "corn and other plants suitable to various conditions of localities and"
33111 "climate in artificially irrigated gardens that represented the main"
33111 "source of nourishment, and even kept a few tamed animals--the Mexicans"
33111 "the turkey and other birds, the Peruvians the llama. Furthermore they"
33111 "were familiar with the use of metals--iron excepted, and for this reason"
33111 "they could not get along yet without stone weapons and stone implements."
33111 "The conquest by the Spaniards cut short all further independent"
33111 "development."
33111 ""
33111 "In the East, the middle stage of barbarism began with the taming of milk"
33111 "and meat producing animals, while the cultivation of plants seems to"
33111 "have remained unknown far into this period. It appears that the taming"
33111 "and raising of animals and the formation of large herds gave rise to the"
33111 "separation of Aryans and Semites from the rest of the barbarians. Names"
33111 "of animals are still common to the languages of European and Asian"
33111 "Aryans, while this is almost never the case with the names of cultivated"
33111 "plants."
33111 ""
33111 "In suitable localities, the formation of herds led to a nomadic life, as"
33111 "with the Semites in the grassy plains of the Euphrates and Tigris, the"
33111 "Aryans in the plains of India, of the Oxus, Jaxartes, Don and Dnieper."
33111 "Along the borders of such pasture lands, the taming of animals must have"
33111 "been accomplished first. But later generations conceived the mistaken"
33111 "idea that the nomadic tribes had their origin in regions supposed to be"
33111 "the cradle of humanity, while in reality their savage ancestors and even"
33111 "people in the lower stage of barbarism would have found these regions"
33111 "almost unfit for habitation. On the other hand, once these barbarians of"
33111 "the middle stage were accustomed to nomadic life, nothing could have"
33111 "induced them to return voluntarily from the grassy river plains to the"
33111 "forests that had been the home of their ancestors. Even when Semites and"
33111 "Aryans were forced further to the North and West, it was impossible for"
33111 "them to occupy the forest regions of Western Asia and Europe, until they"
33111 "were enabled by agriculture to feed their animals on this less favorable"
33111 "soil and especially to maintain them during the winter. It is more than"
33111 "probable that the cultivation of grain was due primarily to the demand"
33111 "for stock feed, and became an important factor of human sustenance at a"
33111 "later period."
33111 ""
33111 "The superior development of Aryans and Semites is, perhaps, attributable"
33111 "to the copious meat and milk diet of both races, more especially to the"
33111 "favorable influence of such food on the growth of children. As a matter"
33111 "of fact, the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico who live on an almost purely"
33111 "vegetarian diet, have a smaller brain than the Indians in the lower"
33111 "stage of barbarism who eat more meat and fish. At any rate, cannibalism"
33111 "gradually disappears at this stage and is maintained only as a religious"
33111 "observance or, what is here nearly identical, as a magic remedy.[6]"
33111 ""
33111 "3. Higher Stage. Beginning with the melting of iron ore and merging into"
33111 "civilization by the invention of letter script and its utilization for"
33111 "writing records. This stage which is passed independently only on the"
33111 "Eastern Hemisphere, is richer in improvements of production than all"
33111 "preceding stages together. It is the stage of the Greek heroes, the"
33111 "Italian tribes shortly before the foundation of Rome, the Germans of"
33111 "Tacitus, the Norsemen of the Viking age."
33111 ""
33111 "We are here confronted for the first time with the iron ploughshare"
33111 "drawn by animals, rendering possible agriculture on a large scale, in"
33111 "fields, and hence a practically unlimited increase in the production of"
33111 "food for the time being. The next consequence is the clearing of forests"
33111 "and their transformation into arable land and meadows--which process,"
33111 "however, could not be continued on a larger scale without the help of"
33111 "the iron ax and the iron spade. Naturally, these improvements brought a"
33111 "more rapid increase of population and a concentration of numbers into a"
33111 "small area. Before the time of field cultivation a combination of half a"
33111 "million of people under one central management could have been possible"
33111 "only under exceptionally favorable conditions; most likely this was"
33111 "never the case."
33111 ""
33111 "The greatest attainments of the higher stage of barbarism are presented"
33111 "in Homer's poems, especially in the Iliad. Improved iron tools; the"
33111 "bellows; the hand-mill; the potter's wheel; the preparation of oil and"
33111 "wine; a well developed fashioning of metals verging on artisanship; the"
33111 "wagon and chariot; ship-building with beams and boards; the beginning of"
33111 "artistic architecture; towns surrounded by walls with turrets and"
33111 "battlements; the Homeric epos and the entire mythology--these are the"
33111 "principal bequests transmitted by the Greeks from barbarism to"
33111 "civilization. In comparing these attainments with the description given"
33111 "by Cesar or even Tacitus of Germans, who were in the beginning of the"
33111 "same stage of evolution which the Greeks were preparing to leave for a"
33111 "higher one, we perceive the wealth of productive development comprised"
33111 "in the higher stage of barbarism."

33111 "The sketch which I have here produced after Morgan of the evolution of"
33111 "the human race through savagery and barbarism to the beginning of"
33111 "civilization is even now rich in new outlines. More still, these"
33111 "outlines are incontrovertible, because traced directly from production."
33111 "Nevertheless, this sketch will appear faint and meagre in comparison to"
33111 "the panorama unrolled to our view at the end of our pilgrimage. Not"
33111 "until then will it be possible to show in their true light both the"
33111 "transition from barbarianism to civilization and the striking contrast"
33111 "between them. For the present we can summarize Morgan's arrangement in"
33111 "the following manner: Savagery--time of predominating appropriation of"
33111 "finished natural products; human ingenuity invents mainly tools useful"
33111 "in assisting this appropriation. Barbarism--time of acquiring the"
33111 "knowledge of cattle raising, of agriculture and of new methods for"
33111 "increasing the productivity of nature by human agency. Civilization:"
33111 "time of learning a wider utilization, of natural products, of"

33111 "Morgan, who spent the greater part of his life among the Iroquois in the"
33111 "State of New York and who had been adopted into one of their tribes, the"
33111 "Senecas, found among them a system of relationship that was in"
33111 "contradiction with their actual family relations. Among them existed"
33111 "what Morgan terms the syndyasmian or pairing family, a monogamous state"
33111 "easily dissolved by either side. The offspring of such a couple was"
33111 "identified and acknowledged by all the world. There could be no doubt to"
33111 "whom to apply the terms father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister."
33111 "But the actual use of these words was not in keeping with their"
33111 "fundamental meaning. For the Iroquois addresses as sons and daughters"
33111 "not only his own children, but also those of his brothers; and he is"
33111 "called father by all of them. But the children of his sisters he calls"
33111 "nephews and nieces, and they call him uncle. Vice versa, an Iroquois"
33111 "woman calls her own children as well as those of her sisters sons and"
33111 "daughters and is addressed as mother by them. But the children of her"
33111 "brothers are called nephews and nieces, and they call her aunt. In the"
33111 "same way, the children of brothers call one another brothers and"
33111 "sisters, and so do the children of sisters. But the children of a sister"
33111 "call those of her brother cousins, and vice versa. And these are not"
33111 "simply meaningless terms, but expressions of actually existing"
33111 "conceptions of proximity and remoteness, equality or inequality of"
33111 "consanguinity."
33111 ""
33111 "These conceptions serve as the fundament of a perfectly elaborated"
33111 "system of relationship, capable of expressing several hundred different"
33111 "relations of a single individual. More still, this system is not only"
33111 "fully accepted by all American Indians--no exception has been found so"
33111 "far--but it is also in use with hardly any modifications among the"
33111 "original inhabitants of India, among the Dravidian tribes of the Dekan"
33111 "and the Gaura tribes of Hindostan."

33111 "than two hundred different family relations. And among these East Indian"
33111 "tribes also, as among all American Indians, the relations arising out of"
33111 "the prevailing form of the family are not in keeping with the system of"
33111 "kinship."
33111 ""
33111 "How can this be explained? In view of the important role played by"
33111 "kinship in the social order of all the savage and barbarian races, the"
33111 "significance of such a widespread system cannot be obliterated by"
33111 "phrases."
33111 ""
33111 "A system that is generally accepted in America, that also exists in Asia"
33111 "among people of entirely different races, that is frequently found in a"
33111 "more or less modified form all over Africa and Australia, such a system"
33111 "requires a historical explanation and cannot be talked down, as was"
33111 "attempted, e. g., by McLennan. The terms father, child, brother, sister"
33111 "are more than mere honorary titles; they carry in their wake certain"
33111 "well-defined and very serious obligations, the aggregate of which"
33111 "comprises a very essential part of the social constitution of those"
33111 "nations. And the explanation was found. In the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii)"
33111 "there existed up to the first half of the nineteenth century a family"
33111 "form producing just such fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters,"
33111 "uncles and aunts, nephews and nieces, as the old Indo-American system of"
33111 "kinship. But how remarkable! The Hawaiian system of kinship again did"
33111 "not agree with the family form actually prevailing there. For there all"
33111 "the children of brothers and sisters, without any exception, are"
33111 "considered brothers and sisters, and regarded as the common children not"
33111 "only of their mother or her sisters, or their father and his brothers,"
33111 "but of all the brothers and sisters of their parents without"
33111 "distinction. While thus the American system of kinship presupposes an"
33111 "obsolete primitive form of the family, which is still actually existing"
33111 "in Hawaii, the Hawaiian system on the other hand points to a still more"
33111 "primitive form of the family, the actual existence of which cannot be"
33111 "proved any more, but which must have existed, because otherwise such a"
33111 "system of kinship could not have arisen. According to Morgan, the family"
33111 "is the active element; it is never stationary, but in progression from a"
33111 "lower to a higher form in the same measure in which society develops"
33111 "from a lower to a higher stage. But the systems of kinship are passive."
33111 "Only in long intervals they register the progress made by the family in"
33111 "course of time, and only then are they radically changed, when the"
33111 "family has done so. \"And,\" adds Marx, \"it is the same with political,"
33111 "juridical, religious and philosophical systems in general.\" While the"
33111 "family keeps on growing, the system of kinship becomes ossified. The"
33111 "latter continues in this state and the family grows beyond it. With the"
33111 "same certainty which enabled Cuvier to conclude from some bones of"
33111 "Marsupialia found near Paris that extinct marsupialia had lived there,"
33111 "with this same certainty may we conclude from a system of kinship"
33111 "transmitted by history that the extinct form of the family corresponding"
33111 "to this system was once in existence."
33111 ""
33111 "The systems of kinship and forms of the family just mentioned differ"
33111 "from the present systems in that every child has several fathers and"
33111 "mothers. Under the American system to which the Hawaiian system"
33111 "corresponds, brother and sister cannot be father and mother of the same"
33111 "child; but the Hawaiian system presupposes a family, in which, on the"
33111 "contrary, this was the rule. We are here confronted by a series of"
33111 "family forms that are in direct contradiction with those that were"
33111 "currently regarded as alone prevailing. The conventional conception"
33111 "knows only monogamy, furthermore polygamy of one man, eventually also"
33111 "polyandry of one woman. But it passes in silence, as is meet for a"
33111 "moralizing philistine, that the practice silently but without"
33111 "compunction supersedes these barriers sanctioned officially by society."
33111 "The study of primeval history, however, shows us conditions, where men"
33111 "practiced polygamy and women at the same time polyandry, so that their"
33111 "children were considered common to all; conditions that up to their"
33111 "final transition into monogamy underwent a whole series of"
33111 "modifications. These modifications slowly and gradually contract the"

33111 "couple remains which prevails to-day."
33111 ""
33111 "In thus constructing backward the history of the family, Morgan, in"
33111 "harmony with the majority of his colleagues, arrives at a primeval"

33111 "lower stage. But I can only conclude from all these facts that they"

33111 "fertilizing itself in every one of its sections. But if we confine"
33111 "ourselves to mammals, we find all forms of sexual intercourse, license,"
33111 "suggestions of group marriage, polygamy and monogamy. Only polyandry is"
33111 "missing;[8] that could be accomplished by men only. Even our next"
33111 "relations, the quadrumana, exhibit all possible differences in the"
33111 "grouping of males and females. And if we draw the line still closer and"
33111 "consider only the four anthropoid apes, Letourneau can only tell us,"
33111 "that they are now monogamous, now polygamous; while Saussure contends"
33111 "according to Giraud-Teulon that they are monogamous. The recent"
33111 "contentions of Westermarck[9] in regard to monogamy among anthropoid"
33111 "apes are far from proving anything. In short, the information is such"
33111 "that honest Letourneau admits: \"There exists no strict relation at all"
33111 "between the degree of intellectual development and the form of sexual"
33111 "intercourse among mammals.\" And Espinas says frankly:[10] \"The herd is"
33111 "the highest social group found among animals. It seems to be composed of"
33111 "families, but from the outset the family and the herd are antagonistic;"
33111 "they develop in directly opposite ratio.\""
33111 ""
33111 "It is evident from the above that we know next to nothing of the family"
33111 "and other social groups of anthropoid apes; the reports are directly"
33111 "contradictory. How full of contradiction, how much in need of critical"
33111 "scrutiny and research are the reports even on savage human tribes! But"
33111 "monkey tribes are far more difficult to observe than human tribes. For"
33111 "the present, therefore, we must decline all final conclusions from such"
33111 "absolutely unreliable reports."
33111 ""
33111 "The quotation from Espinas, however, offers a better clue. Among higher"
33111 "animals, the herd and family are not supplements of one another, but"
33111 "antitheses. Espinas demonstrates very nicely, how the jealousy of the"
33111 "males loosens or temporarily dissolves every herd during mating time."
33111 "\"Where the family is closely organized, herds are formed only in"
33111 "exceptional cases. But wherever free sexual intercourse or polygamy are"
33111 "existing, the herd appears almost spontaneously.... In order that a herd"
33111 "may form, family ties must be loosened and the individual be free. For"
33111 "this reason we so rarely find organized herds among birds.... Among"
33111 "mammals, however, we find groups organized after a fashion, just because"
33111 "here the individual is not merged in the family.... The rising sense of"
33111 "cohesion in a herd cannot, therefore, have a greater enemy than the"
33111 "consciousness of family ties. Let us not shrink from pronouncing it: the"
33111 "development of a higher form of society than the family can be due only"
33111 "to the fact that it admitted families which had undergone a thorough"
33111 "change. This does not exclude the possibility that these same families"
33111 "were thus enabled to reorganize later on under infinitely more favorable"
33111 "circumstances.\"[11]"
33111 ""
33111 "It becomes apparent from this, that animal societies may indeed have a"
33111 "certain value in drawing conclusions in regard to human life--but only"
33111 "negatively. The higher vertebrate knows, so far as we may ascertain,"
33111 "only two forms of the family: polygamy or pairs. In both of them there"
33111 "is only one grown male, only one husband. The jealousy of the male, at"
33111 "the same time tie and limit of the family, creates an opposition between"
33111 "the animal family and the herd. The latter, a higher social form, is"
33111 "here rendered impossible, there loosened or dissolved during mating"
33111 "time, and at best hindered in its development by the jealousy of the"
33111 "male. This in itself is sufficient proof that the animal family and"
33111 "primeval human society are irreconcilable; that ancient man, struggling"
33111 "upward from the animal stage, either had no family at all or at the most"
33111 "one that does not exist among animals. A being so defenceless as"
33111 "evolving man might well survive in small numbers though living in an"
33111 "isolated state, the highest social form of which is that of pairs such"
33111 "as Westermarck, relying on hunter's reports, attributes to the gorilla"
33111 "and the chimpanzee. Another element is necessary for the elevation out"
33111 "of the animal stage, for the realization of the highest progress found"
33111 "in nature: the replacing of the defencelessness of the single individual"
33111 "by the united strength and co-operation of the whole herd. The"
33111 "transition from beast to man out of conditions of the sort under which"
33111 "the anthropoid apes are living to-day would be absolutely unexplainable."
33111 "These apes rather give the impression of stray sidelines gradually"
33111 "approaching extinction, and at all events in process of decline. This"
33111 "alone is sufficient to reject all parallels between their family forms"
33111 "and those of primeval man. But mutual tolerance of the grown males,"
33111 "freedom from jealousy, was the first condition for the formation of such"
33111 "large and permanent groups, within which alone the transformation from"
33111 "beast to man could be accomplished. And indeed, what do we find to be"
33111 "the most ancient and original form of the family, undeniably traceable"
33111 "by history and even found to-day here and there? The group marriage,"
33111 "that form in which whole groups of men and whole groups of women"
33111 "mutually belong to one another, leaving only small scope for jealousy."
33111 "And furthermore we find at a later stage the exceptional form of"
33111 "polyandry which still more supersedes all sentiments of jealousy and"
33111 "hence is unknown to animals."
33111 ""
33111 "But all the forms of the group marriage known to us are accompanied by"
33111 "such peculiarly complicated circumstances that they of necessity point"
33111 "to a preceding simpler form of sexual intercourse and, hence, in the"
33111 "last instance to a period of unrestricted sexual intercourse"
33111 "corresponding to a transition from the animal to man. Therefore the"
33111 "references to animal marriages lead us back to precisely that point,"
33111 "from which they were intended to remove us forever."
33111 ""
33111 "What does the term \"unrestricted sexual intercourse\" mean? Simply, that"
33111 "the restrictions in force now were not observed formerly. We have"
33111 "already seen the barrier of jealousy falling. If anything is certain, it"
33111 "is that jealousy is developed at a comparatively late stage. The same is"
33111 "true of incest. Not only brother and sister were originally man and"
33111 "wife, but also the sexual intercourse between parents and children is"
33111 "permitted to this day among many nations. Bancroft testifies to the"
33111 "truth of this among the Kaviats of the Behring Strait, the Kadiaks of"
33111 "Alaska, the Tinnehs in the interior of British North America; Letourneau"
33111 "compiled reports of the same fact in regard to the Chippeway Indians,"
33111 "the Coocoos in Chile, the Caribeans, the Carens in Indo-China, not to"
33111 "mention the tales of ancient Greeks and Romans about the Parthians,"
33111 "Persians, Scythians, Huns and so forth. Before incest was invented (and"
33111 "it is an invention, a really valuable one indeed), sexual intercourse"
33111 "between parents and children could not be any more repulsive than"
33111 "between other persons belonging to different generations, which takes"
33111 "place even in our day among the most narrow-minded nations without"
33111 "causing any horror. Even old \"maids\" of more than sixty years sometimes,"
33111 "if they are rich enough, marry young men of about thirty. Eliminating"
33111 "from the primeval forms of the family known to us those conceptions of"
33111 "incest--conceptions totally different from ours and often enough in"
33111 "direct contradiction with them--we arrive at a form of sexual"
33111 "intercourse that can only be designated as unrestricted. Unrestricted in"
33111 "the sense that the barriers drawn later on by custom did not yet exist."
33111 "This in no way necessarily implies for practical purposes an injudicious"
33111 "pell-mell intercourse. The separate existence of pairs for a limited"
33111 "time is not out of the question, and even comprises the majority of"
33111 "cases in the group marriage of our days. And if the latest repudiator of"
33111 "such a primeval state, Westermarck, designates as marriage every case,"
33111 "where both sexes remain mated until the birth of the offspring, then"
33111 "this is equivalent to saying that this kind of marriage may well exist"
33111 "during a stage of unrestricted intercourse without contradicting"
33111 "license, i. e., absence of barriers drawn by custom for sexual"
33111 "intercourse. Westermarck bases himself on the opinion that \"license"
33111 "includes the suppression of individual affections\" so that \"prostitution"
33111 "is its most genuine form.\" To me it rather seems that any understanding"
33111 "of primeval conditions is impossible as long as we look at them through"
33111 "brothel spectacles. We shall return to this point in the group marriage."
33111 ""
33111 "According to Morgan, the following forms developed from this primeval"
33111 "state at an apparently early stage:"
33111 ""
33111 ""
33111 "1. THE CONSANGUINE FAMILY."
33111 ""
33111 "The Consanguine Family is the first step toward the family. Here the"
33111 "marriage groups are arranged by generations: all the grand-fathers and"
33111 "grand-mothers within a certain family are mutually husbands and wives;"
33111 "and equally their children, the fathers and mothers, whose children form"
33111 "a third cycle of mutual mates. The children of these again, the"
33111 "great-grandchildren of the first cycle, will form a fourth. In this form"
33111 "of the family, then, only ancestors and descendants are excluded from"
33111 "what we would call the rights and duties of marriage. Brothers and"
33111 "sisters, male and female cousins of the first, second and more remote"
33111 "grades, are all mutually brothers and sisters and for this reason mutual"
33111 "husbands and wives. The relation of brother and sister quite naturally"
33111 "includes at this stage the practice of sexual intercourse.[12]"
33111 ""
33111 "The typical form of such a family would consist of the offspring of one"
33111 "pair, representing again the descendants of each grade as mutual"
33111 "brothers and sisters and, therefore, mutual husbands and wives. The"
33111 "consanguine family is extinct. Even the crudest nations of history do"
33111 "not furnish any proofs of it. But the Hawaiian system of kinship, in"
33111 "force to this day in all Polynesia, compels us to acknowledge its"
33111 "former existence, for it exhibits grades of kinship that could only"
33111 "originate in this form of the family. And the whole subsequent"
33111 "development of the family compels us to admit this form as a necessary"
33111 "step."
33111 ""
33111 ""
33111 "2. THE PUNALUAN FAMILY."
33111 ""
33111 "While the first step of organization consisted in excluding parents and"
33111 "children from mutual sexual intercourse, the second was the erection of"
33111 "a barrier between brother and sister. This progress was much more"
33111 "important on account of the greater equality in the ages of the parties"
33111 "concerned, but also far more difficult. It was accomplished gradually,"
33111 "probably beginning with the exclusion of the natural sister (i. e., on"
33111 "the mother's side) from sexual intercourse, first in single cases, then"
33111 "becoming more and more the rule (in Hawaii exceptions were still noted"
33111 "during the nineteenth century), and finally ending with the prohibition"
33111 "of marriage even among collateral brothers and sisters, i. e., what we"
33111 "now term brother's and sister's children, grandchildren, and"
33111 "great-grandchildren. This progress offers, according to Morgan, an"
33111 "excellent illustration how the principle of natural selection works."
33111 "Without question, the tribes limiting inbreeding by this progress"
33111 "developed faster and more completely than those retaining the marriage"
33111 "between brothers and sisters as a rule and law. And how powerfully the"
33111 "influence of this progress was felt, is shown by the institution of the"
33111 "gens, directly attributable to it and passing far beyond the goal. The"
33111 "gens is the foundation of the social order of most, if not all,"
33111 "barbarian nations, and in Greece and Rome we step immediately from it to"
33111 "civilization."
33111 ""
33111 "Every primeval family necessarily had to divide after a few generations."
33111 "The originally communistic and collective household existing far into"
33111 "the middle stage of barbarism, involved a certain maximum size of the"
33111 "family, variable according to conditions, but still limited in a degree."
33111 "As soon as the conception of the impropriety of sexual intercourse"
33111 "between children of the same mother arose, it naturally became effective"
33111 "on such occasions as the division of old and the foundation of new"
33111 "household communities (which, however, did not necessarily coincide with"
33111 "the family group). One or more series of sisters became the center of"
33111 "one group, their natural brothers that of another. In this or a similar"
33111 "manner that form which Morgan styles the Punaluan family developed from"
33111 "the consanguine family. According to Hawaiian custom, a number of"
33111 "sisters, natural or more remote (i. e., cousins of the first, second and"
33111 "more remote degrees) were the mutual wives of their mutual husbands,"
33111 "their natural brothers excepted. These men now no longer addressed one"
33111 "another as \"brother\"--which they no longer had to be--but as \"Punalua,\""
33111 "i. e., intimate companion, associate as it were. Likewise a series of"
33111 "natural or more remote brothers lived in mutual marriage with a number"
33111 "of women, not their natural sisters, and these women referred to each"
33111 "other as \"Punalua.\" This is the classical form of a family, which later"
33111 "admitted of certain variations. Its fundamental characteristic was"
33111 "mutual community of husbands and wives within a given family with the"
33111 "exclusion of the natural brothers (or sisters) first, and of the more"
33111 "remote grades later."
33111 ""
33111 "This form of the family, now, furnishes with complete accuracy the"
33111 "degrees of kinship expressed by the American system. The children of the"
33111 "sisters of my mother still are her children; likewise the children of"
33111 "the brothers of my father still his children; and all of them are my"
33111 "brothers and sisters. But the children of the brothers of my mother are"
33111 "now her nephews and nieces, the children of the sisters of my father"
33111 "his nephew and nieces, and they are all my cousins. For while the"
33111 "husbands of the sisters of my mother are still her husbands, and"
33111 "likewise the wives of the brothers of my father still his"
33111 "wives--legally, if not always in fact--the social proscription of sexual"
33111 "intercourse between brothers and sisters has now divided those relatives"
33111 "who were formerly regarded without distinction as brothers and sisters,"
33111 "into two classes. In one category are those who remain (more remote)"
33111 "brothers and sisters as before; in the other the children of the brother"
33111 "on one hand or the sister on the opposite, who can be brothers and"
33111 "sisters no longer. The latter have mutual parents no more, neither"
33111 "father nor mother nor both together. And for this reason the class of"
33111 "nephews and nieces, male and female cousins, here becomes necessary for"
33111 "the first time. Under the former family order this would have been"
33111 "absurd. The American system of kinship, which appears absolutely"
33111 "paradoxical in any family form founded on monogamy, is rationally"
33111 "explained and naturally confirmed in its most minute details by the"
33111 "Punaluan family. Wherever this system of kinship was in force, there the"
33111 "Punaluan family or at least a form akin to it must also have existed."
33111 ""
33111 "This family form, the existence of which in Hawaii was actually"
33111 "demonstrated, would have been transmitted probably by all Polynesia, if"
33111 "the pious missionaries, similar to the Spanish monks in America, could"
33111 "have looked upon such anti-Christian relations as being something more"
33111 "than simply a \"horror.\"[13] Cesar's report to the effect that the"
33111 "Britons, who then were in the middle stage of barbarism, \"have ten or"
33111 "twelve women in common, mostly brothers with brothers and parents with"
33111 "children,\" is best explained by group marriage. Barbarian mothers have"
33111 "not ten or twelve sons old enough to keep women in common, but the"
33111 "American system of kinship corresponding to the Punaluan family"
33111 "furnishes many brothers, because all near and remote cousins of a"
33111 "certain man are his brothers. The term \"parents with children\" may arise"
33111 "from a wrong conception of Cesar, but this system does not absolutely"
33111 "exclude the existence of father and son, mother or daughter in the same"
33111 "group. It does exclude, however, father and daughter or mother and son."
33111 "This or a similar form of group marriage also furnishes the easiest"
33111 "explanation of the reports of Herodotus and other ancient writers"
33111 "concerning community of women among savage and barbarian nations. This"
33111 "is true, furthermore, of Watson's and Kaye's[14] tale about the Tikurs"
33111 "of Audh (north of the Ganges): \"They live together (i. e., sexually)"
33111 "almost indiscriminately in large communities, and though two persons may"
33111 "be considered as being married, still the tie is only nominal.\""

33111 "The institution of the gens seems to have its origin in the majority of"
33111 "cases in the Punaluan family. True, the Australian class system also"
33111 "offers a starting point for it; the Australians have gentes, but not yet"
33111 "a Punaluan family, only a cruder form of group marriage.[15]"
33111 ""
33111 "In all forms of the group family it is uncertain who is the father of a"

33111 "mother toward them, still she knows her natural children from others."
33111 "It is also obvious that, as far as group marriage exists, descent can"
33111 "only be traced on the mother's side and, hence, only female lineage be"
33111 "acknowledged. This is actually the case among all savage tribes and"
33111 "those in the lower stage of barbarism. To have discovered this first is"
33111 "the second great merit of Bachofen. He designates this exclusive"
33111 "recognition of descent from the female line and the hereditary relations"

33111 "second and more remote descendants of natural sisters), their children"

33111 "the lowest stage of development among the Papuans near Mount Gambier in"
33111 "South Australia. Here the whole tribe is divided into two great classes,"
33111 "Kroki and Kumite.[16] Sexual intercourse within each of these classes is"
33111 "strictly prohibited. But every man of one class is by birth the husband"
33111 "of every woman of the other class, and vice versa. Not the individuals"
33111 "are married to one another, but the whole groups, class to class. And"
33111 "mark well, no caution is made anywhere on account of difference of age"
33111 "or special consanguinity, unless it is resulting from the division into"
33111 "two exogamous classes. A Kroki has for his wife every Kumite woman. And"
33111 "as his own daughter, being the daughter of a Kumite woman, is also"
33111 "Kumite according to maternal law, she is therefore the born wife of"
33111 "every Kroki, including her father. At least, the class organization, as"
33111 "we know it, does not exclude this possibility. Hence this organization"
33111 "either arose at a time when, in spite of all dim endeavor to limit"
33111 "inbreeding, sexual intercourse between parents and children was not yet"
33111 "regarded with any particular horror; in this case the class system would"
33111 "be directly evolved from a condition of unrestricted sexual relations."

33111 "by custom, when the classes were formed; and in this case the present"
33111 "condition points back to the consanguine family and is the first step"
33111 "out of it. The latter case is the more probable. So far as I know, no"
33111 "mention is made of any sexual intercourse between parents and children"
33111 "in Australia. Even the later form of exogamy, the maternal law gens, as"
33111 "a rule silently presupposes that the prohibition of this intercourse"
33111 "was an accomplished fact at the time of its institution."

33111 "The system of two classes is not only found near Mount Gambier in South"

33111 "her the principal husband among others. This fact in no small degree"
33111 "contributed to the confusion among missionaries, who regarded group"
33111 "marriage now as a disorderly community of women, now as an arbitrary"
33111 "adultery. Such a habitual pairing would gain ground the more the gens"
33111 "developed and the more numerous the classes of \"brothers\" and \"sisters\""
33111 "became who were not permitted to marry one another. The impulse to"
33111 "prevent marriage of consanguineous relatives started by the gens went"
33111 "still further. Thus we find that among the Iroquois and most of the"
33111 "Indians in the lower stage of barbarism marriage is prohibited between"
33111 "all the relatives of their system of kinship, and this comprises several"
33111 "hundred kinds. By this increasing complication of marriage restrictions,"
33111 "group marriage became more and more impossible; it was displaced by the"
33111 "pairing family. At this stage one man lives with one woman, but in such"
33111 "a manner that polygamy, and occasional adultery, remain privileges of"
33111 "men, although the former occurs rarely for economic reasons. Women,"
33111 "however, are generally expected to be strictly faithful during the time"
33111 "of living together, and adultery on their part is cruelly punished. But"
33111 "the marriage-tie may be easily broken by either party, and the children"
33111 "belong to the mother alone, as formerly."
33111 ""
33111 "In this ever more extending restriction of marriage between"
33111 "consanguineous relations, natural selection also remains effective. As"
33111 "Morgan expresses it: \"Marriages between gentes that were not"
33111 "consanguineous produced a more vigorous race, physically and mentally;"
33111 "two progressive tribes intermarried, and the new skulls and brains"
33111 "naturally expanded until they comprised the faculties of both.\" Thus"
33111 "tribes composed of gentes necessarily either gained the supremacy over"
33111 "the backward ones or, by their example, carried them along in their"

33111 "The development of the family, then, is founded on the continual"
33111 "contraction of the circle, originally comprising the whole tribe, within"
33111 "which marital intercourse between both sexes was general. By the"
33111 "continual, exclusion, first of near, then of ever remoter relatives,"
33111 "including finally even those who were simply related legally, all group"
33111 "marriage becomes practically impossible. At last only one couple,"
33111 "temporarily and loosely united, remains; that molecule, the dissolution"
33111 "of which absolutely puts an end to marriage. Even from this we may infer"
33111 "how little the sexual love of the individual in the modern sense of the"
33111 "word had to do with the origin of monogamy. The practice of all nations"
33111 "of that stage still more proves this. While in the previous form of the"
33111 "family the men were never embarrassed for women, but rather had more"
33111 "than enough of them, women now became scarce and were sought after. With"
33111 "the pairing family, therefore, the abduction and barter of women"
33111 "began--widespread symptoms, and nothing but that, of a new and much more"
33111 "profound change. The pedantic Scot, McLennan, however, transmuted these"
33111 "symptoms, mere methods of obtaining women, into separate classes of the"
33111 "family under the head of \"marriage by capture\" and \"marriage by barter.\""
33111 "Moreover among American Indians and other nations in the same stage, the"
33111 "marriage agreement is not the business of the parties most concerned,"
33111 "who often are not even asked, but of their mothers. Frequently two"
33111 "persons entirely unknown to one another are thus engaged to be married"
33111 "and receive no information of the closing of the bargain, until the time"
33111 "for the marriage ceremony approaches. Before the wedding, the bridegroom"
33111 "brings gifts to the maternal relatives of the bride (not to her father"
33111 "or his relatives) as an equivalent for ceding the girl to him. Either of"
33111 "the married parties may dissolve the marriage at will. But among many"
33111 "tribes, as, e. g., the Iroquois, public opinion has gradually become"
33111 "averse to such separations. In case of domestic differences the gentile"
33111 "relatives of both parties endeavor to bring about a reconciliation, and"

33111 "on of the new labor power, the slaves. But according to the same custom,"
33111 "his children could not inherit his property, for the following reasons:"
33111 "By maternal law, i. e., while descent was traced only along the female"
33111 "line, and by the original custom of inheriting in the gens, the gentile"
33111 "relatives inherited the property of their deceased gentile relative. The"
33111 "wealth had to remain in the gens. In view of the insignificance of the"
33111 "objects, the property may have gone in practice to the closest gentile"
33111 "relatives, i. e., the consanguine relatives on the mother's side. The"
33111 "children of the dead man, however, did not belong to his gens, but to"
33111 "that of their mother. They inherited first together with the other"
33111 "consanguine relatives of the mother, later on perhaps in preference to"
33111 "the others. But they could not inherit from their father, because they"
33111 "did not belong to his gens, where his property had to remain. Hence,"
33111 "after the death of a cattle owner, the cattle would fall to his"
33111 "brothers, sisters and the children of his sisters, or to the offspring"
33111 "of the sisters of his mother. His own children were disinherited."

33111 "In the measure of the increasing wealth man's position in the family"
33111 "became superior to that of woman, and the desire arose to use this"
33111 "fortified position for the purpose of overthrowing the traditional law"
33111 "of inheritance in favor of his children. But this was not feasible as"
33111 "long as maternal law was valid. This law had to be abolished, and it"
33111 "was. This was by no means as difficult as it appears to us to-day. For"
33111 "this revolution--one of the most radical ever experienced by"
33111 "humanity--did not have to touch a single living member of the gens. All"
33111 "its members could remain what they had always been. The simple"
33111 "resolution was sufficient, that henceforth the offspring of the male"
33111 "members should belong to the gens, while the children of the female"
33111 "members should be excluded by transferring them to the gens of their"
33111 "father. This abolished the tracing of descent by female lineage and the"
33111 "maternal right of inheritance, and instituted descent by male lineage"
33111 "and the paternal right of inheritance. How and when this revolution was"
33111 "accomplished by the nations of the earth, we do not know. It belongs"
33111 "entirely to prehistoric times. That it was accomplished is proven more"
33111 "than satisfactorily by the copious traces of maternal law collected"
33111 "especially by Bachofen. How easily it is accomplished we may observe in"
33111 "a whole series of Indian tribes, that recently passed through or are"
33111 "still engaged in it, partly under the influence of increasing wealth and"
33111 "changed modes of living (transfer from forests to the prairie), partly"
33111 "through the moral pressure of civilization and missionaries. Six out of"
33111 "eight Missouri tribes have male descent and inheritance, while only two"
33111 "retain female descent and inheritance. The Shawnees, Miamis and"
33111 "Delawares follow the custom of placing their children into the male gens"
33111 "by giving them a gentile name belonging to the father's gens, so that"
33111 "they may be entitled to inherit. \"Innate casuistry of man, to change the"

33111 "to the leading couple and its children, but to the slaves alone. Famulus"

33111 "entrance of the Germans into history, probably because on account of"
33111 "their poverty their monogamy had not yet fully outgrown the pairing"

33111 "in use among the distinguished and the leaders of the tribes, as was the"
33111 "case in the pairing families of the American Indians. Secondly, the"
33111 "transition from maternal to paternal law could have taken place only a"
33111 "short while before, because the mother's brother--the next male relative"
33111 "in the gens by maternal law--was still considered almost a closer"
33111 "relative than the natural father, also in accordance with the standpoint"
33111 "of the American Indians. The latter furnished to Marx, according to his"
33111 "own testimony, the key to the comprehension of German primeval history."

33111 "the Germans. The new monogamy now developing the ruins of the Roman"
33111 "world from the mixture of nations endowed male rule with a milder form"

33111 "This progress doubtless arose from the fact that the Germans still lived"

33111 "It has been often disputed that the Punaluan family ever existed outside"

33111 "the so-called patriarchal family was preceded by the matriarchal family,"

33111 "We now come to another discovery of Morgan that is at least as important"
33111 "as the reconstruction of the primeval form of the family from the"
33111 "systems of kinship. It is the proof that the sex organizations within"
33111 "the tribe of North American Indians, designated by animal names, are"
33111 "essentially identical with the genea of the Greeks and the gentes of the"
33111 "Romans; that the American form is the original from which the Greek and"
33111 "Roman forms were later derived; that the whole organization of Greek and"
33111 "Roman society during primeval times in gens, phratry and tribe finds its"
33111 "faithful parallel in that of the American Indians; that the gens is an"
33111 "institution common to all barbarians up to the time of civilization--at"
33111 "least so far as our present sources of information reach. This"
33111 "demonstration has cleared at a single stroke the most difficult passages"
33111 "of remotest ancient Greek and Roman history. At the same time it has"
33111 "given us unexpected information concerning the fundamental outlines of"
33111 "the constitution of society in primeval times--before the introduction"
33111 "of the state. Simple as the matter is after we have once found it out,"
33111 "still it was only lately discovered by Morgan. In his work of 1871 he"
33111 "had not yet unearthed this mystery. Its revelation has completely"
33111 "silenced for the time being those generally so overconfident English"
33111 "authorities on primeval history."
33111 ""
33111 "The Latin word gens, used by Morgan generally for the designation of"
33111 "this sex organization, is derived, like the equivalent Greek word"
33111 "genos, from the common Aryan root gan, signifying to beget. Gens, genos,"
33111 "Sanskrit dschanas, Gothic kuni, ancient Norse and Anglesaxon kyn,"
33111 "English kin, Middle High German kuenne, all signify lineage, descent."
33111 "Gens in Latin, genos in Greek, specially designate that sex organization"
33111 "which boasted of common descent (from a common sire) and was united into"
33111 "a separate community by certain social and religious institutions, but"
33111 "the origin and nature of which nevertheless remained obscure to all our"
33111 "historians."
33111 ""
33111 "Elsewhere, in speaking of the Punaluan family, we saw how the gens was"
33111 "constituted in its original form. It consisted of all individuals who by"
33111 "means of the Punaluan marriage and in conformity with the conceptions"
33111 "necessarily arising in it made up the recognized offspring of a certain"
33111 "ancestral mother, the founder of that gens. Since fatherhood is"
33111 "uncertain in this form of the family, female lineage is alone valid. And"
33111 "as brothers must not marry their sisters, but only women of foreign"
33111 "descent, the children bred from these foreign women do not belong to the"
33111 "gens, according to maternal law. Hence only the offspring of the"
33111 "daughters of every generation remain in the same sex organization. The"
33111 "descendants of the sons are transferred to the gentes of the new"
33111 "mothers. What becomes of this group of kinship when it constitutes"
33111 "itself a separate group, distinct from similar groups in the same tribe?"
33111 ""
33111 "As the classical form of this original gens Morgan selects that of the"
33111 "Iroquois, more especially that of the Seneca tribe. This tribe has eight"
33111 "gentes named after animals: 1. Wolf. 2. Bear. 3. Turtle. 4. Beaver. 5."
33111 "Deer. 6. Snipe. 7. Heron. 8. Hawk. Every gens observes the following"
33111 "customs:"
33111 ""
33111 "1. The gens elects its sachem (official head during peace) and its chief"
33111 "(leader in war). The sachem must be selected within the gens and his"
33111 "office was in a sense hereditary. It had to be filled immediately after"
33111 "a vacancy occurred. The chief could be selected outside of the gens, and"
33111 "his office could even be temporarily vacant. The son never followed his"
33111 "father in the office of sachem, because the Iroquois observed maternal"
33111 "law, in consequence of which the son belonged to another gens. But the"
33111 "brother or the son of a sister was often elected as a successor. Men and"
33111 "women both voted in elections. The election, however, had to be"
33111 "confirmed by the other seven gentes, and then only the sachem-elect was"
33111 "solemnly invested, by the common council of the whole Iroquois"
33111 "federation. The significance of this will be seen later. The power of"
33111 "the sachem within the tribe was of a paternal, purely moral nature. He"
33111 "had no means of coercion at his command. He was besides by virtue of his"
33111 "office a member of the tribal council of the Senecas and of the federal"
33111 "council of the whole Iroquois nation. The Chief had the right to command"
33111 "only in times of war."
33111 ""
33111 "2. The gens can retire the sachem and the chief at will. This again is"
33111 "done by men and women jointly. The retired men are considered simple"
33111 "warriors and private persons like all others. The tribal council, by the"
33111 "way, can also retire the sachems, even against the will of the tribe."
33111 ""
33111 "3. No member is permitted to marry within the gens. This is the"
33111 "fundamental rule of the gens, the tie that holds it together. It is the"
33111 "negative expression of the very positive blood relationship, by virtue"
33111 "of which the individuals belonging to it become a gens. By the discovery"
33111 "of this simple fact Morgan for the first time revealed the nature of the"
33111 "gens. How little the gens had been understood before him is proven by"
33111 "former reports on savages and barbarians, in which the different"
33111 "organizations of which the gentile order is composed are jumbled"
33111 "together without understanding and distinction as tribe, clan, thum,"
33111 "etc. Sometimes it is stated that intermarrying within these"
33111 "organizations is forbidden. This gave rise to the hopeless confusion, in"
33111 "which McLennan could pose as Napoleon and establish order by the decree:"
33111 "All tribes are divided into those that forbid intermarrying (exogamous)"
33111 "and those that permit it (endogamous). And after he had thus made"
33111 "confusion worse confounded, he could indulge in deep meditations which"
33111 "of his two preposterous classes was the older: exogamy or endogamy. By"
33111 "the discovery of the gens founded on affinity of blood and the resulting"
33111 "impossibility of its members to intermarry, this nonsense found a"
33111 "natural end. It is self understood that the marriage interdict within"
33111 "the gens was strictly observed at the stage in which we find the"
33111 "Iroquois."
33111 ""
33111 "4. The property of deceased members fell to the share of the other"
33111 "gentiles; it had to remain in the gens. In view of the insignificance of"
33111 "the objects an Iroquois could leave behind, the nearest gentile"
33111 "relations divided the heritage. Was the deceased a man, then his natural"
33111 "brothers, sisters and the brothers of the mother shared in his property."
33111 "Was it a woman, then her children and natural sisters shared, but not"
33111 "her brothers. For this reason husband and wife could not inherit from"
33111 "one another, nor the children from the father."
33111 ""
33111 "5. The gentile members owed to each other help, protection and"
33111 "especially assistance in revenging injury inflicted by strangers. The"
33111 "individual relied for his protection on the gens and could be assured of"
33111 "it. Whoever injured the individual, injured the whole gens. From this"
33111 "blood kinship arose the obligation to blood revenge that was"
33111 "unconditionally recognized by the Iroquois. If a stranger killed a"
33111 "gentile member, the whole gens of the slain man was pledged to revenge"
33111 "his death. First mediation was tried. The gens of the slayer deliberated"
33111 "and offered to the gentile council of the slain propositions for"
33111 "atonement, consisting generally in expressions of regret and presents of"
33111 "considerable value. If these were accepted, the matter was settled. In"
33111 "the opposite case the injured gens appointed one or more avengers who"
33111 "were obliged to pursue the slayer and to kill him. If they succeeded,"
33111 "the gens of the slayer had no right to complain. The account was"
33111 "squared."
33111 ""
33111 "6. The gens had certain distinct names or series of names, which no"
33111 "other gens in the whole tribe could use, so that the name of the"
33111 "individual indicated to what gens he belonged. A gentile name at the"
33111 "same time bestowed gentile rights."
33111 ""
33111 "7. The gens may adopt strangers who thereby are adopted into the whole"
33111 "tribe. The prisoners of war who were not killed became by adoption into"
33111 "a gens tribal members of the Senecas and thus received full gentile and"
33111 "tribal rights. The adoption took place on the motion of some gentile"
33111 "members, of men who accepted the stranger as a brother or sister, of"
33111 "women who accepted him as a child. The solemn introduction into the gens"
33111 "was necessary to confirm the adoption. Frequently certain gentes that"
33111 "had shrunk exceptionally were thus strengthened by mass adoptions from"
33111 "another gens with the consent of the latter. Among the Iroquois the"
33111 "solemn introduction into the gens took place in a public meeting of the"
33111 "tribal council, whereby it actually became a religious ceremony."
33111 ""
33111 "The existence of special religious celebrations among Indian gentes can"
33111 "hardly be demonstrated. But the religious rites of the Indians are more"
33111 "or less connected with the gens. At the six annual religious festivals"
33111 "of the Iroquois the sachems and chiefs of the different gentes were"
33111 "added to the \"Keepers of the Faith\" and had the functions of priests."
33111 ""
33111 "9. The gens had a common burial place. Among the Iroquois of the State"
33111 "of New York, who are crowded by white men all around them, the burial"
33111 "place has disappeared, but it existed formerly. Among other Indians it"
33111 "is still in existence, e. g., among the Tuscaroras, near relatives of"
33111 "the Iroquois, where every gens has a row by itself in the burial place,"
33111 "although they are Christians. The mother is buried in the same row as"
33111 "her children, but not the father. And among the Iroquois the whole gens"
33111 "of the deceased attends the funeral, prepares the grave and provides the"
33111 "addresses, etc."
33111 ""
33111 "10. The gens had a council, the democratic assembly of all male and"
33111 "female gentiles of adult age, all with equal suffrage. This council"
33111 "elected and deposed its sachems and chiefs; likewise the other \"Keepers"
33111 "of the Faith.\" It deliberated on gifts of atonement or blood revenge for"
33111 "murdered gentiles and it adopted strangers into the gens. In short, it"
33111 "was the sovereign power in the gens."
33111 ""
33111 "The following are the rights and privileges of the typical Indian gens,"
33111 "according to Morgan: \"All the members of an Iroquois gens were"
33111 "personally free, and they were bound to defend each other's freedom;"
33111 "they were equal in privileges and in personal rights, the sachems and"
33111 "chiefs claiming no superiority; and they were a brotherhood bound"
33111 "together by ties of kin. Liberty, equality and fraternity, though never"
33111 "formulated, were cardinal principles of the gens. These facts are"
33111 "material, because the gens was the unit of a social and governmental"
33111 "system, the foundation upon which Indian society was organized. A"
33111 "structure composed of such units would of necessity bear the impress of"
33111 "their character, for as the unit, so the compound. It serves to explain"
33111 "that sense of independence and personal dignity universally an"
33111 "attribute of Indian character.\""
33111 ""
33111 "At the time of the discovery the Indians of entire North America were"
33111 "organized in gentes by maternal law. Only \"in some tribes, as among the"
33111 "Dakotas, the gentes had fallen out; in others as among the Ojibwas, the"
33111 "Omahas and the Mayas of Yucatan, descent had been changed from the"
33111 "female to the male line.\""
33111 ""
33111 "Among many Indian tribes with more than five or six gentes we find"
33111 "three, four or more gentes united into a separate group, called phratry"
33111 "by Morgan in accurate translation of the Indian name by its Greek"
33111 "equivalent. Thus the Senecas have two phratries, the first comprising"
33111 "gentes one to four, the second gentes five to eight. Closer"
33111 "investigation shows that these phratries generally represent the"
33111 "original gentes that formed the tribe in the beginning. For the marriage"
33111 "interdict necessitated the existence of at least two gentes in a tribe"
33111 "in order to realize its separate existence. As the tribe increased,"
33111 "every gens segmented into two or more new gentes, while the original"
33111 "gens comprising all the daughter gentes, lived on in the phratry. Among"
33111 "the Senecas and most of the other Indians \"the gentes in the same"
33111 "phratry are brother gentes to each other, and cousin gentes to those of"
33111 "the other phratry\"--terms that have a very real and expressive meaning"
33111 "in the American system of kinship, as we have seen. Originally no Seneca"
33111 "was allowed to marry within his phratry, but this custom has long become"
33111 "obsolete and is now confined to the gens. According to the tradition"
33111 "among the Senecas, the bear and the deer were the two original gentes,"
33111 "from which the others were formed by segmentation. After this new"
33111 "institution had become well established it was modified according to"
33111 "circumstances. If certain gentes became extinct, it sometimes happened"
33111 "that by mutual consent the members of one gens were transferred in a"
33111 "body from other phratries. Hence we find the gentes of the same name"
33111 "differently grouped in the phratries of the different tribes."
33111 ""
33111 "\"The phratry, among the Iroquois, was partly for social and partly for"
33111 "religious objects.\" 1. In the ball game one phratry plays against"
33111 "another. Each one sends its best players, the other members, upon"
33111 "different sides of the field, watch the game and bet against one another"
33111 "on the result. 2. In the tribal council the sachems and chiefs of each"
33111 "phratry are seated opposite one another, every speaker addressing the"
33111 "representatives of each phratry as separate bodies. 3. When a murder had"
33111 "been committed in the tribe, the slayer and the slain belonging to"
33111 "different phratries, the injured gens often appealed to its brother"
33111 "gentes. These held a phratry council which in a body addressed itself to"
33111 "the other phratry, in order to prevail on the latter to assemble in"
33111 "council and effect a condonation of the matter. In this case the phratry"
33111 "re-appears in its original gentile capacity, and with a better prospect"
33111 "of success than the weaker gens, its daughter. 4. At the funeral of"
33111 "prominent persons the opposite phratry prepared the interment and the"
33111 "burial rites, while the phratry of the deceased attended the funeral as"
33111 "mourners. If a sachem died, the opposite phratry notified the central"
33111 "council of the Iroquois that the office of the deceased had become"
33111 "vacant. 5. In electing a sachem the phratry council also came into"
33111 "action. Endorsement by the brother gentes was generally considered a"
33111 "matter of fact, but the gentes of the other phratry might oppose. In"
33111 "such a case the council of this phratry met, and if it maintained its"
33111 "opposition, the election was null and void. 6. Formerly the Iroquois had"
33111 "special religious mysteries, called medicine lodges by the white men."
33111 "These mysteries were celebrated among the Senecas by two religious"
33111 "societies that had a special form of initiation for new members; each"
33111 "phratry was represented by one of these societies. 7. If, as is almost"
33111 "certain, the four lineages occupying the four quarters of Tlascala at"
33111 "the time of the conquest were four phratries, then it is proved that the"
33111 "phratries were at the same time military units, as were the Greek"
33111 "phratries and similar sex organizations of the Germans. Each of these"
33111 "four lineages went into battle as a separate group with its special"
33111 "uniform and flag and its own leader."
33111 ""
33111 "Just as several genres form a phratry so in the classical form several"
33111 "phratries form a tribe. In some cases the middle group, the phratry, is"

33111 "What constitutes an Indian tribe in America? 1. A distinct territory and"
33111 "a distinct name. Every tribe had a considerable hunting and fishing"
33111 "ground beside the place of its actual settlement. Beyond this territory"
33111 "there was a wide neutral strip of land reaching over to the boundaries"
33111 "of the next tribe; a smaller strip between tribes of related languages,"
33111 "a larger between tribes of foreign languages. This corresponds to the"
33111 "boundary forest of the Germans, the desert created by Caesar's Suevi"
33111 "around their territory, the isarnholt (Danish jarnved, Latin limei"
33111 "Danicus) between Danes and Germans, the sachsen wald (Saxon forest) and"

33111 "the case in some resolutions of German mark (border) communities. It was"
33111 "the special duty of the tribal council to regulate the relations with"
33111 "foreign tribes. The council received and despatched legations, declared"
33111 "war and made peace. War was carried on principally by volunteers."

33111 "Expeditions against such enemies were generally organized by certain"
33111 "prominent warriors. They started a war dance, and whoever took part in"
33111 "it thereby declared his intention to join the expedition. Ranks were"
33111 "formed and the march began immediately. The defense of the attacked"
33111 "tribal territory was also generally carried on by volunteers. The exodus"
33111 "and the return of such columns was always the occasion of public"
33111 "festivities. The consent of the tribal council for such expeditions was"
33111 "not required, and was neither asked nor given. This corresponds to the"
33111 "private war expeditions of German followers described by Tacitus. Only"
33111 "these German groups of followers had already assumed a more permanent"
33111 "character, forming a standing center organized during peace, around"
33111 "which the other volunteers gathered in case of war. Such war columns"
33111 "were rarely strong in numbers. The most important expeditions of the"
33111 "Indians, even for long distances, were undertaken by insignificant"
33111 "forces. If more than one group joined for a great expedition, every"
33111 "group obeyed its own leader. The uniformity of the campaign plan was"
33111 "secured as well as possible by a council of these leaders. This is the"

33111 "decide. He represents a feeble, but generally undeveloped prototype of"

33111 "find the highest form of such a league among the Iroquois. Emigrating"
33111 "from their settlements west of the Mississippi, where they probably"
33111 "formed a branch of the great Dakota family, they settled at last after"
33111 "long wanderings in the present State of New York. They had five tribes:"
33111 "Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneidas and Mohawks. They lived on fish,"
33111 "venison, and the products of rough gardening, inhabiting villages"
33111 "protected by stockades. Their number never exceeded 20,000, and certain"
33111 "gentes were common to all five tribes. They spoke closely related"
33111 "dialects of the same language and occupied territories contiguous to one"
33111 "another. As this land was won by conquest, it was natural for these"
33111 "tribes to stand together against the expelled former inhabitants. This"
33111 "led, not later than the beginning of the fifteenth century, to a regular"
33111 "\"eternal league,\" a sworn alliance that immediately assumed an"
33111 "aggressive character, relying on its newly won strength. About 1675, at"
33111 "the summit of its power, it had conquered large districts round about"
33111 "and partly expelled the inhabitants, partly made them tributary. The"
33111 "Iroquois League represented the most advanced social organization"

33111 "consanguinity formed the true fundament of the league. Three of these"
33111 "tribes, called father tribes, were brothers to one another; the other"
33111 "two, also mutual brothers, were called son tribes. The three oldest"
33111 "gentes were represented by living members in all five tribes, and these"
33111 "members were all regarded as brothers. Three other gentes were still"
33111 "alive in three tribes, and all of their members called one another"

33111 "constitution of the German Mark as a purely social institution,"
33111 "essentially different from that of a state, though furnishing the"
33111 "fundament on which a state constitution could be erected later on. Hence"
33111 "in all of his writings, he traced the gradual rise of the public power"
33111 "of coercion from and by the side of primordial constitutions of marks,"
33111 "villages, farms and towns. The North American Indians show how an"
33111 "originally united tribe gradually spreads over an immense continent; how"
33111 "tribes by segmentation become nations, whole groups of tribes; how"
33111 "languages change so that they not only become unintelligible to one"
33111 "another, but also lose every trace of former unity; how at the same time"
33111 "one gens splits up into several gentes, how the old mother gentes are"
33111 "preserved in the phratries and how the names of these oldest gentes"
33111 "still remain the same in widely distant and long separated tribes. Wolf"

33111 "missing, as e. g. among the Dorians; the league of tribes might not be"

33111 "the time of their entrance into history, the Greeks were on the"
33111 "threshold of civilization. Two full periods of evolution are stretching"
33111 "between the Greeks and the above named American tribes. The Greeks of"

33111 "Grecian gens no longer retains the archaic character of the Iroquois"
33111 "gens. The stamp of group marriage is becoming rather blurred. Maternal"
33111 "law had given way to paternal lineage. Rising private property had thus"
33111 "made its first opening in the gentile constitution. A second opening"
33111 "naturally followed the first: Paternal law being now in force, the"
33111 "fortune of a wealthy heiress would have fallen to her husband in the"

33111 "developed out of independent and wholly unrelated families. But this"

33111 "mutual relation of all members of the gens. They learned this important"
33111 "fact by practice from early childhood. With the advent of the monogamous"
33111 "family this was gradually forgotten. The gentile name created a pedigree"
33111 "by the side of which that of the monogamous family seemed insignificant."
33111 "This name had now the function of preserving the memory of the common"
33111 "descent of its bearers. But the pedigree of the gens went so far back"
33111 "that the gentiles could no longer actually ascertain their mutual"
33111 "kinship, except in a limited number of more recent common ancestors. The"

33111 "How the state gradually developed by partly transforming the organs of"
33111 "the gentile constitution, partly replacing them by new organs and"
33111 "finally installing real state authorities; how the place of the nation"
33111 "in arms defending itself through its gentes, phratries and tribes, was"
33111 "taken by an armed public power of coercion in the hands of these"
33111 "authorities and available against the mass of the people; nowhere can we"
33111 "observe the first act of this drama so well as in ancient Athens. The"
33111 "essential stages of the various transformations are outlined by Morgan,"
33111 "but the analysis of the economic causes producing them is largely added"
33111 "by myself."
33111 ""
33111 "In the heroic period, the four tribes of the Athenians were still"
33111 "installed in separate parts of Attica. Even the twelve phratries"
33111 "composing them seem to have had separate seats in the twelve different"
33111 "towns of Cecrops. The constitution was in harmony with the period: a"
33111 "public meeting (agora), a council (bule) and a basileus."
33111 ""
33111 "As far back as we can trace written history we find the land divided up"
33111 "and in the possession of private individuals. For during the last period"
33111 "of the higher stage of barbarism the production of commodities and the"
33111 "resulting trade had well advanced. Grain, wine and oil were staple"
33111 "articles. The sea trade on the Aegean Sea drifted more and more out of"
33111 "the hands of the Phoenicians into those of the Athenians. By the"
33111 "purchase and sale of land, by continued division of labor between"
33111 "agriculture and industry, trade and navigation, the members of gentes,"
33111 "phratries and tribes very soon intermingled. The districts of the"
33111 "phratry and the tribe received inhabitants who did not belong to these"
33111 "bodies and, therefore, were strangers in their own homes, although they"
33111 "were countrymen. For during times of peace, every phratry and every"
33111 "tribe administered its own affairs without consulting the council of"
33111 "Athens or the basileus. But inhabitants not belonging to the phratry or"
33111 "the tribe could not take part in the administration of these bodies."
33111 ""
33111 "Thus the well-regulated functions of the gentile organs became so"
33111 "disarranged that relief was already needed during the heroic period. A"
33111 "constitution attributed to Theseus was introduced. The main feature of"
33111 "this change was the institution of central administration in Athens. A"
33111 "part of the affairs that had so long been conducted autonomously by the"
33111 "tribes was declared collective business and transferred to a general"
33111 "council in Athens. This step of the Athenians went farther than any ever"
33111 "taken by the nations of America. For the simple federation of autonomous"
33111 "tribes was now replaced by the conglomeration of all tribes into one"
33111 "single body. The next result was a common Athenian law, standing above"
33111 "the legal traditions of the tribes and gentes. It bestowed on the"
33111 "citizens of Athens certain privileges and legal protection, even in a"
33111 "territory that did not belong to their tribe. This meant another blow to"
33111 "the gentile constitution; for it opened the way to the admission of"
33111 "citizens who were not members of any Attic tribe and stood entirely"
33111 "outside of the Athenian gentile constitution."
33111 ""
33111 "A second institution attributed to Theseus was the division of the"
33111 "entire nation into three classes regardless of the gentes, phratries and"
33111 "tribes: eupatrides or nobles, geomoroi or farmers, and demiurgoi or"
33111 "tradesmen. The exclusive privilege of the nobles to fill the offices"
33111 "was included in this innovation. Apart from this privilege the new"
33111 "division remained ineffective, as it did not create any legal"
33111 "distinctions between the classes. But it is important, because it shows"
33111 "us the new social elements that had developed in secret. It shows that"
33111 "the habitual holding of gentile offices by certain families had already"
33111 "developed into a practically uncontested privilege; that these families,"
33111 "already powerful through their wealth, began to combine outside of their"
33111 "gentes into a privileged class; and that the just arising state"
33111 "sanctioned this assumption. It shows furthermore that the division of"
33111 "labor between farmers and tradesmen had grown strong enough to contest"
33111 "the supremacy of the old gentile and tribal division of society. And"
33111 "finally it proclaims the irreconcilable opposition of gentile society to"
33111 "the state. The first attempt to form a state broke up the gentes by"
33111 "dividing their members against one another and opposing a privileged"
33111 "class to a class of disowned belonging to two different branches of"
33111 "production."
33111 ""
33111 "The ensuing political history of Athens up to the time of Solon is only"
33111 "incompletely known. The office of basileus became obsolete. Archons"
33111 "elected from the ranks of the nobility occupied the leading position in"
33111 "the state. The power of the nobility increased continually, until it"
33111 "became unbearable about the year 600 before Christ. The principal means"
33111 "for stifling the liberty of the people were--money and usury. The main"
33111 "seat of the nobility was in and around Athens. There the sea trade and"
33111 "now and then a little convenient piracy enriched them and concentrated"
33111 "the money into their hands. From this point the gradually arising money"
33111 "power penetrated like corrugating acid into the traditional modes of"
33111 "rural existence founded on natural economy. The gentile constitution is"
33111 "absolutely irreconcilable with money rule. The ruin of the Attic"
33111 "farmers coincided with the loosening of the old gentile bonds that"
33111 "protected them. The debtor's receipt and the pawning of the"
33111 "property--for the mortgage was also invented by the Athenians--cared"
33111 "neither for the gens nor for the phratry. But the old gentile"
33111 "constitution knew nothing of money, advance and debt. Hence the ever"
33111 "more virulently spreading money rule of the nobility developed a new"
33111 "legal custom, securing the creditor against the debtor and sanctioning"
33111 "the exploitation of the small farmer by the wealthy. All the rural"
33111 "districts of Attica were crowded with mortgage columns bearing the"
33111 "legend that the lot on which they stood was mortgaged to such and such"
33111 "for so much. The fields that were not so designated had for the most"
33111 "part been sold on account of overdue mortgages or interest and"
33111 "transferred to the aristocratic usurers. The farmer could thank his"
33111 "stars, if he was granted permission to live as a tenant on one-sixth of"
33111 "the product of his labor and to pay five-sixths to his new master in the"
33111 "form of rent. Worse still, if the sale of the lot did not bring"
33111 "sufficient returns to cover the debt, or if such a debt had been"
33111 "contracted without a lien, then the debtor had to sell his children into"
33111 "slavery abroad in order to satisfy the claim of the creditor. The sale"
33111 "of the children by the father--that was the first fruit of paternal law"
33111 "and monogamy! And if that did not satisfy the bloodsuckers, they could"
33111 "sell the debtor himself into slavery. Such was the pleasant dawn of"
33111 "civilization among the people of Attica."

33111 "Formerly, while the condition of the people was in keeping with gentile"
33111 "traditions, a similar downfall would have been impossible. But here it"
33111 "had come about, nobody knew how. Let us return for a moment to the"
33111 "Iroquois. The state of things that had imposed itself on the Athenians"
33111 "almost without their doing, so to say, and assuredly against their will,"
33111 "was inconceivable among the Indians. There the ever unchanging mode of"
33111 "production could at no time generate such conflicts as a distinction"
33111 "between rich and poor, exploiters and exploited, caused by external"
33111 "conditions. The Iroquois were far from controlling the forces of nature,"
33111 "but within the limits drawn for them by nature they dominated their own"
33111 "production. Apart from a failure of the crops in their little gardens,"
33111 "the exhaustion of the fish supply in their lakes and rivers or of the"
33111 "game stock in their forests, they always knew what would be the outcome"
33111 "of their mode of gaining a living. A more or less abundant supply of"
33111 "food, that would come of it. But the outcome could never be any"
33111 "unpremeditated social upheavals, breaking of gentile bonds or division"
33111 "of the gentiles against one another by conflicting class interests."
33111 "Production was carried on in the most limited manner; but--the producers"
33111 "controlled their own product. This immense advantage of barbarian"
33111 "production was lost in the transition to civilization. To win it back on"
33111 "the basis of man's present gigantic control of nature and of the free"
33111 "association rendered possible by it, that will be the task of the next"

33111 "another's product, then they lost the control of it. They did not know"
33111 "any more what became of it. There was a possibility that the product"
33111 "might be turned against the producers for the purpose of exploiting and"

33111 "although he could do so with plots of land. The division of labor"
33111 "between the different branches of production--agriculture, trades,"
33111 "numberless specialties within the trades, commerce, navigation,"
33111 "etc.--had developed more fully with the progress of industry and"
33111 "traffic. The population was now divided according to occupations into"
33111 "rather well defined groups, everyone of which had separate interests not"
33111 "guarded by the gens or phratry and therefore necessitating the creation"
33111 "of new offices. The number of slaves had increased considerably and must"
33111 "have surpassed by far that of the free Athenians even at this early"
33111 "stage. Gentile society originally knew no slavery and was, therefore,"
33111 "ignorant of any means to hold this mass of bondsmen in check. And"
33111 "finally, commerce had attracted a great many strangers who settled in"
33111 "Athens for the sake of the easier living it afforded. According to the"
33111 "old constitution, the strangers had neither civil rights nor the"
33111 "protection of the law. Though tacitly admitted by tradition, they"
33111 "remained a disturbing and foreign element."
33111 ""
33111 "In short, gentile constitution approached its doom. Society was daily"
33111 "growing more and more beyond it. It was powerless to stop or allay even"
33111 "the most distressing evils that had grown under its very eyes. But in"
33111 "the meantime the state had secretly developed. The new groups formed by"
33111 "division of labor, first between city and country, then between the"
33111 "various branches of city industry, had created new organs for the care"
33111 "of their interests. Public offices of every description had been"
33111 "instituted. And above all the young state needed its own fighting"
33111 "forces. Among the seafaring Athenians this had to be at first only a"
33111 "navy, for occasional short expeditions and the protection of the"
33111 "merchant vessels. At some uncertain time before Solon, the naukrariai"
33111 "were instituted, little territorial districts, twelve in each tribe."
33111 "Every naukraria had to furnish, equip and man a war vessel and to detail"
33111 "two horsemen. This arrangement was a twofold attack on the gentile"
33111 "constitution. In the first place it created a public power of coercion"
33111 "that did no longer absolutely coincide with the entirety of the armed"
33111 "nation. In the second place it was the first division of the people for"
33111 "public purposes, not by groups of kinship, but by local residence. We"
33111 "shall soon see what that signified."
33111 ""
33111 "As the gentile constitution could not come to the assistance of the"
33111 "exploited people, they could look only to the rising state. And the"
33111 "state brought help in the form of the constitution of Solon. At the same"
33111 "time it added to its own strength at the expense of the old"
33111 "constitution. Solon opened the series of so-called political revolutions"
33111 "by an infringement on private property. We pass over the means by which"
33111 "this reform was accomplished in the year 594 B. C. or thereabout. Ever"
33111 "since, all revolutions have been revolutions for the protection of one"
33111 "kind of property against another kind of property. They cannot protect"
33111 "one kind without violating another. In the great French revolution the"
33111 "feudal property was sacrificed for the sake of saving bourgeois"
33111 "property. In Solon's revolution, the property of the creditors had to"
33111 "make concessions to the property of the debtors. The debts were simply"
33111 "declared illegal. We are not acquainted with the accurate details, but"
33111 "Solon boasts in his poems that he removed the mortgage columns from the"
33111 "indented lots and enabled all who had fled or been sold abroad for debts"
33111 "to return home. This was only feasible by an open violation of private"
33111 "property. And indeed, all so-called political revolutions were started"
33111 "for the protection of one kind of property by the confiscation, also"
33111 "called theft, of another kind of property. It is absolutely true that"
33111 "for more than 2,500 years private property could only be protected by"
33111 "the violation of private property."
33111 ""
33111 "But now a way had to be found to avoid the return of such an enslavement"
33111 "of the free Athenians. This was first attempted by general measures, e."
33111 "g., the prohibition of contracts giving the person of the debtor in"
33111 "lien. Furthermore a maximum limit was fixed for the amount of land any"
33111 "one individual could own, in order to keep the craving of the nobility"
33111 "for the land of the farmers within reasonable bounds. Constitutional"
33111 "amendments were next in order. The following deserve special"
33111 "consideration:"
33111 ""
33111 "The council was increased to four hundred members, one hundred from each"
33111 "tribe. Here, then, the tribe still served as a basis. But this was the"
33111 "only remnant of the old constitution that was transferred to the new"
33111 "body politic. For otherwise Solon divided the citizens into four classes"
33111 "according to their property in land and its yield. Five hundred, three"
33111 "hundred and one hundred and fifty medimnoi of grain (1 medimnos equals"
33111 "1.16 bushels) were the minimum yields of the first three classes."
33111 "Whoever had less land or none at all belonged to the fourth class. Only"
33111 "members of the first three classes could hold office; the highest"
33111 "offices were filled by the first class. The fourth class had only the"
33111 "right to speak and vote in the public council. But here all officials"
33111 "were elected, here they had to give account, here all the laws were"
33111 "made, and here the fourth class was in the majority. The aristocratic"
33111 "privileges were partly renewed in the form of privileges of wealth, but"
33111 "the people retained the decisive power. The four classes also formed the"
33111 "basis for the reorganization of the fighting forces. The first two"
33111 "classes furnished the horsemen; the third had to serve as heavy"
33111 "infantry; the fourth was employed as light unarmored infantry and had to"
33111 "man the navy. Probably the last class also received wages in this case."
33111 ""
33111 "An entirely new element is thus introduced into the constitution:"
33111 "private property. The rights and duties of the citizens are graduated"
33111 "according to their property in land. Wherever the classification by"
33111 "property gains ground, there the old groups of blood relationship give"
33111 "way. Gentile constitution has suffered another defeat."
33111 ""
33111 "However, the gradation of political rights according to private property"
33111 "was not one of those institutions without which a state cannot exist. It"
33111 "may have been ever so important in the constitutional development of"
33111 "some states. Still a good many others, and the most completely developed"
33111 "at that, had no need of it. Even in Athens it played only a passing"
33111 "role. Since the time of Aristides, all offices were open to all the"
33111 "citizens."
33111 ""
33111 "During the next eighty years the Athenian society gradually drifted into"
33111 "the course on which it further developed in the following centuries. The"
33111 "outrageous land speculation of the time before Solon had been fettered,"
33111 "likewise the excessive concentration of property in land. Commerce,"
33111 "trades and artisan handicrafts, which were carried on in an ever larger"
33111 "scale as slave labor increased, became the ruling factors in gaining a"
33111 "living. Public enlightenment advanced. Instead of exploiting their own"
33111 "fellow citizens in the old brutal style, the Athenians now exploited"
33111 "mainly the slaves and the customers outside. Movable property, wealth in"
33111 "money, slaves and ships, increased more and more. But instead of being a"
33111 "simple means for the purchase of land, as in the old stupid times, it"
33111 "had now become an end in itself. The new class of industrial and"
33111 "commercial owners of wealth now waged a victorious competition against"
33111 "the old nobility. The remnants of the old gentile constitution lost"
33111 "their last hold. The gentes, phratries and tribes, the members of which"
33111 "now were dispersed all over Attica and completely intermixed, had thus"
33111 "become unavailable as political groups. A great many citizens of Athens"
33111 "did not belong to any gens. They were immigrants who had been adopted"
33111 "into citizenship, but not into any of the old groups of kinship."
33111 "Besides, there was a steadily increasing number of foreign immigrants"
33111 "who were only protected by traditional sufferance."
33111 ""
33111 "Meanwhile the struggles of the parties proceeded. The nobility tried to"
33111 "regain their former privileges and for a short time recovered their"
33111 "supremacy, until the revolution of Kleisthenes (509 B. C.) brought their"
33111 "final downfall and completed the ruin of gentile law."
33111 ""
33111 "In his new constitution, Kleisthenes ignored the four old tribes founded"
33111 "on the gentes and phratries. Their place was taken by an entirely new"
33111 "organization based on the recently attempted division of the citizens"
33111 "into naukrariai according to residence. No longer was membership in a"
33111 "group of kindred the dominant fact, but simply local residence. Not the"
33111 "nation, but the territory was now divided; the inhabitants became mere"
33111 "political fixtures of the territory."
33111 ""
33111 "The whole of Attica was divided into one hundred communal districts,"
33111 "so-called demoi, every one of which was autonomous. The citizens living"
33111 "in a demos (demotoi) elected their official head (demarchos), treasurer"
33111 "and thirty judges with jurisdiction in minor cases. They also received"
33111 "their own temple and divine guardian or heros, whose priest they"
33111 "elected. The control of the demos was in the hands of the council of"
33111 "demotoi. This is, as Morgan correctly remarks, the prototype of the"
33111 "autonomous American township. The modern state in its highest"
33111 "development ended in the same unit with which the rising state began its"
33111 "career in Athens."
33111 ""
33111 "Ten of these units (demoi) formed a tribe, which, however, was now"
33111 "designated as local tribe in order to distinguish it from the old sex"
33111 "tribe. The local tribe was not only an autonomous political, but also a"
33111 "military group. It elected the phylarchos or tribal head who commanded"
33111 "the horsemen, the taxiarchos commanding the infantry and the strategic"
33111 "leader, who was in command of the entire contingent raised in the tribal"
33111 "territory by conscription. The local tribe furthermore furnished,"
33111 "equipped and fully manned five war vessels. It was designated by the"
33111 "name of the Attic hero who was its guardian deity. It elected fifty"
33111 "councilmen into the council of Athens."
33111 ""
33111 "Thus we arrive at the Athenian state, governed by a council of five"
33111 "hundred elected by and representing the ten tribes and subject to the"
33111 "vote of the public meeting, where every citizen could enter and vote."
33111 "Archons and other officials attended to the different departments of"
33111 "administration and justice."
33111 ""
33111 "By this new constitution and by the admission of a large number of"
33111 "aliens, partly freed slaves, partly immigrants, the organs of gentile"
33111 "constitution were displaced in public affairs. They became mere private"
33111 "and religious clubs. But their moral influence, the traditional"
33111 "conceptions and views of the old gentile period, survived for a long"
33111 "time and expired only gradually. This was evident in another state"
33111 "institution."
33111 ""
33111 "We have seen that an essential mark of the state consists in a public"
33111 "power of coercion divorced from the mass of the people. Athens possessed"
33111 "at that time only a militia and a navy equipped and manned directly by"
33111 "the people. These afforded protection against external enemies and held"
33111 "the slaves in check, who at that time already made up the large majority"
33111 "of the population. For the citizens, this coercive power at first only"
33111 "existed in the shape of the police, which is as old as the state. The"
33111 "innocent Frenchmen of the 18th century, therefore, had the habit of"
33111 "speaking not of civilized, but of policed nations (nations policees)."
33111 "The Athenians, then, provided for a police in their new state, a"
33111 "veritable \"force\" of bowmen on foot and horseback. This police force"
33111 "consisted--of slaves. The free Athenian regarded this police duty as so"
33111 "degrading that he preferred being arrested by an armed slave rather than"
33111 "lending himself to such an ignominious service. That was still a sign of"
33111 "the old gentile spirit. The state could not exist without a police, but"
33111 "as yet it was too young and did not command sufficient moral respect to"
33111 "give prestige to an occupation that necessarily appeared ignominious to"
33111 "the old gentiles."
33111 ""
33111 "How well this state, now completed in its main outlines, suited the"
33111 "social condition of the Athenians was apparent by the rapid growth of"
33111 "wealth, commerce and industry. The distinction of classes on which the"
33111 "social and political institutions are resting was no longer between"
33111 "nobility and common people, but between slaves and freemen, aliens and"
33111 "citizens. At the time of the greatest prosperity the whole number of"
33111 "free Athenian citizens, women and children included, amounted to about"
33111 "90,000; the slaves of both sexes numbered 365,000 and the"
33111 "aliens--foreigners and freed slaves--45,000. Per capita of each adult"
33111 "citizen there were, therefore, at least eighteen slaves and more than"
33111 "two aliens. The great number of slaves is explained by the fact that"
33111 "many of them worked together in large factories under supervision. The"
33111 "development of commerce and industry brought about an accumulation and"
33111 "concentration of wealth in a few hands. The mass of the free citizens"
33111 "were impoverished and had to face the choice of either competing with"
33111 "their own labor against slave labor, which was considered ignoble and"
33111 "vile, besides promising little success, or to be ruined. Under the"
33111 "prevailing circumstances they necessarily chose the latter course and"
33111 "being in the majority they ruined the whole Attic state. Not democracy"
33111 "caused the downfall of Athens, as the European glorifiers of princes and"
33111 "lickspittle schoolmasters would have us believe, but slavery"
33111 "ostracizing the labor of the free citizen."

33111 "The origin of the state among the Athenians presents a very typical form"
33111 "of state organization. For it took place without any marring external"
33111 "interference or internal obstruction--the usurpation of Pisistratos left"
33111 "no trace of its short duration. It shows the direct rise of a highly"

33111 ""
33111 ""
33111 "The legend of the foundation of Rome sets forth that the first"
33111 "colonization was undertaken by a number of Latin gentes (one hundred, so"
33111 "the legend says) united into one tribe. A Sabellian tribe (also said to"
33111 "consist of one hundred gentes) soon followed, and finally a third tribe"
33111 "of various elements, but again numbering one hundred gentes, joined"
33111 "them. The whole tale reveals at the first glance that little more than"
33111 "the gens was borrowed from reality, and that the gens itself was in"
33111 "certain cases only an offshoot of an old mother gens still existing at"
33111 "home. The tribes bear the mark of artificial composition on their"
33111 "foreheads; still they were made up of kindred elements and after the"
33111 "model of the old spontaneous, not artificial tribe. At the same time it"
33111 "is not impossible that a genuine old tribe formed the nucleus of every"
33111 "one of these three tribes. The connecting link, the phratry, contained"
33111 "ten gentes and was called curia. Hence there were thirty curiae."
33111 ""
33111 "The Roman gens is recognized as an institution identical with the"
33111 "Grecian gens. The Grecian gens being a continuation of the same social"
33111 "unit, the primordial form of which we found among the American Indians,"
33111 "the same holds naturally good of the Roman gens, and we can be more"
33111 "concise in its treatment."
33111 ""
33111 "At least during the most ancient times of the city, the Roman gens had"
33111 "the following constitution:"
33111 ""
33111 "1. Mutual right of inheritance for gentiles; the wealth remained in the"
33111 "gens. Paternal law being already in force in the Roman the same as in"
33111 "the Grecian gens, the offspring of female lineage were excluded."
33111 "According to the law of the twelve tablets, the oldest written law of"
33111 "Rome known to us, the natural children had the first title to the"
33111 "estate; in case no natural children existed, the agnati (kin of male"
33111 "lineage) took their place; and last in line came the gentiles. In all"
33111 "cases the property remained in the gens. Here we observe the gradual"
33111 "introduction of new legal provisions, caused by increased wealth and"
33111 "monogamy, into the gentile practice. The originally equal right of"
33111 "inheritance of the gentiles was first limited in practice to the agnati,"
33111 "no doubt at a very remote date, and afterwards to the natural children"
33111 "and their offspring of male lineage. Of course this appears in the"
33111 "reverse order on the twelve tablets."
33111 ""
33111 "2. Possession of a common burial ground. The patrician gens Claudia, on"
33111 "immigrating into Rome from Regilli, was assigned to a separate lot of"
33111 "land and received its own burial ground in the city. As late as the time"
33111 "of Augustus, the head of Varus, who had been killed in the Teutoburger"
33111 "Wald, was brought to Rome and interred in the gentilitius tumulus; hence"
33111 "his gens (Quinctilia) still had its own tomb."
33111 ""
33111 "3. Common religious rites. These are well-known under the name of sacra"
33111 "gentilitia."
33111 ""
33111 "4. Obligation not to intermarry in the gens. It seems that this was"
33111 "never a written law in Rome, but the custom remained. Among the"
33111 "innumerable names of Roman couples preserved for us there is not a"
33111 "single case, where husband and wife had the same gentile name. The law"
33111 "of inheritance proves the same rule. By marrying, a woman loses her"
33111 "agnatic privileges, discards her gens, and neither she nor her children"
33111 "have any title to her father's estate nor to that of his brothers,"
33111 "because otherwise the gens of her father would lose his property. This"
33111 "rule has a meaning only then when the woman is not permitted to marry a"
33111 "gentile."
33111 ""
33111 "5. A common piece of land. In primeval days this was always obtained"
33111 "when the tribal territory was first divided. Among the Latin tribes we"
33111 "find the land partly in the possession of the tribe, partly of the gens,"
33111 "and partly of the households that could hardly represent single families"
33111 "at such an early date. Romulus is credited with being the first to"
33111 "assign land to single individuals, about 2.47 acres (two jugera) per"
33111 "head. But later on we still find some land in the hands of the gentes,"
33111 "not to mention the state land, around which turns the whole internal"
33111 "history of the republic."
33111 ""
33111 "6. Duty of the gentiles to mutually protect and assist one another."
33111 "Written history records only remnants of this law. The Roman state from"
33111 "the outset manifested such superior power, that the duty of protection"
33111 "against injury devolved upon it. When Appius Claudius was arrested, his"
33111 "whole gens, including his personal enemies, dressed in mourning. At the"
33111 "time of the second Punic war the gentes united for the purpose of"
33111 "ransoming their captured gentiles. The senate vetoed this."

33111 "7. Right to bear the gentile name. This was in force until the time of"
33111 "the emperors. Freed slaves were permitted to assume the gentile name of"
33111 "their former master, but this did not bestow any gentile rights on them."
33111 ""
33111 "8. Right of adopting strangers into the gens. This was done by adoption"
33111 "into the family (the same as among the Indians) which brought with it"

33111 "filled by election or nomination, from the king downward, and as the"
33111 "curiae elected also their own priests, we are justified in assuming the"

33111 "still plainly visible.\""
33111 ""
33111 "How confused the ideas of our historians, even the most prominent of"
33111 "them, are when it comes to a discussion of the Roman gens, is shown by"
33111 "the following example: In Mommsen's treatise on the Roman family names"
33111 "of the Republican and Augustinian era (Roemische Forschungen, Berlin,"
33111 "1864, Vol. I.) he writes: \"The gentile name was not only borne by all"
33111 "male gentiles including all adopted and wards, except, of course, the"
33111 "slaves, but also by the women.... The tribe (so Mommsen translates gens)"
33111 "is a common organization resulting from a common--actual, assumed or"
33111 "even invented--ancestor and united by common rites, burial grounds and"
33111 "customs of inheritance. All free individuals, hence women also, may and"
33111 "must claim membership in them. But the definition of the gentile name of"
33111 "the married women offers some difficulty. This is indeed obviated, as"
33111 "long as women were not permitted to marry any one but their gentiles."
33111 "And we have proofs that for a long time the women found it much more"
33111 "difficult to marry outside than inside of the gens. This right of"
33111 "marrying outside, the gentis enuptio, was still bestowed as a personal"
33111 "privilege and reward during the sixth century.... But wherever such"
33111 "outside marriages occurred in primeval times, the woman must have been"
33111 "transferred to the tribe of her husband. Nothing is more certain than"
33111 "that by the old religious marriage woman was completely adopted into"
33111 "the legal and sacramental group of her husband and divorced from her"
33111 "own. Who does not know that the married woman releases her active and"
33111 "passive right of inheritance in favor of her gentiles, but enters the"
33111 "legal group of her husband, her children and his gentiles? And if her"
33111 "husband adopts her as his child into his family, how can she remain"
33111 "separated from his gens?\" (Pages 9-11.)"

33111 "Here Mommsen asserts that the Roman women belonging to a certain gens"
33111 "were originally free to marry only within their gens; the Roman gens,"
33111 "according to him, was therefore endogamous, not exogamous. This opinion"
33111 "which contradicts the evidence of all other nations, is principally, if"
33111 "not exclusively, founded on a single much disputed passage of Livy (Book"
33111 "xxxix, c. 19). According to this passage, the senate decreed in the year"
33111 "568 of the city, i. e., 186 B. C., (uti Feceniae Hispallae datio,"

33111 "If a woman had to intermarry in the gens, as Mommsen assumes, then she"

33111 "place, if the women had to intermarry in the gens, then the men had to"
33111 "do the same, otherwise there could be no marriage. Then we arrive at the"
33111 "conclusion that the man could bequeath a right to his wife, which he did"
33111 "not have for himself. This is a legal impossibility. Mommsen feels this"
33111 "very well, and hence he supposes: \"The marriage outside of the gens most"

33111 "gentiles.\" (Page 10, footnote.) This is not only a very daring"
33111 "assertion, but contradicts also the clear wording of the passage. The"
33111 "senate gives her this right as a proxy of her husband; they expressly"
33111 "give her no more and no less than her husband could have given her, but"
33111 "what they do give is an absolute right, independent of all limitations,"
33111 "so that, if she should make use of it, her new husband shall not suffer"
33111 "in consequence. The senate even instructs the present and future consuls"
33111 "and praetors to see that no inconvenience arise to her from the use of"
33111 "this right. Mommsen's supposition is therefore absolutely inadmissible."

33111 "Nothing remains but to assume that the woman in her first marriage"
33111 "wedded a man from another gens and thereby became a member of her"
33111 "husband's gens. Mommsen admits this for such cases. Then the whole"
33111 "matter at once explains itself. The woman, torn away from her old gens"
33111 "by her marriage and adopted into the gentile group of her husband,"
33111 "occupies a peculiar position in the new gens. She is now a gentile, but"
33111 "not a kin by blood. The manner of her entrance from the outset excludes"
33111 "all prohibition of intermarrying in the gens, into which she has come by"
33111 "marriage. She is adopted into the family relations of the gens and"
33111 "inherits some of the property of her husband when he dies, the property"
33111 "of a gentile. What is more natural than that this property should remain"
33111 "in the gens and that she should be obliged to marry a gentile of her"
33111 "husband and no other? If, however, an exception is to be made, who is so"
33111 "well entitled to authorize her as her first husband who bequeathed his"
33111 "property to her? At the moment when he bequeathes on her a part of his"
33111 "property and simultaneously gives her permission to transfer this"
33111 "property by marriage or as a result of marriage to a strange gens, he"
33111 "still is the owner of this property, hence he literally disposes of his"
33111 "personal property. As for the woman and her relation to the gens of her"
33111 "husband, it is he who by an act of his own free will--the"
33111 "marriage--introduced her into his gens. Therefore it seems quite natural"
33111 "that he should be the proper person to authorize her to leave this gens"
33111 "by another marriage. In short, the matter appears simple and obvious, as"

33111 "survival of a former universal custom. Every family had five acres for"

33111 "this. One thing, however, is plainly proven by the Welsh and Irish laws,"
33111 "namely that the pairing family had not yet given way to monogamy among"
33111 "the Celts of the 11th century. In Wales, marriage did not become"
33111 "indissoluble by divorce, or rather by notification, until after seven"
33111 "years. Even if no more than three nights were lacking to make up the"
33111 "seven years, a married couple could still separate. Their property was"
33111 "divided among them: the woman made the division, the man selected his"
33111 "share. The furniture was divided according to certain very funny rules."
33111 "If the marriage was dissolved by the man, he had to return the woman's"
33111 "dowry and a few other articles; if the woman wished a separation, then"
33111 "she received less. Of three children the man took two, the woman one,"
33111 "viz., the second child. If the woman married again after her divorce,"
33111 "and her first husband claimed her back, she was obliged to follow him,"
33111 "even if she had one foot in her new husband's bed. But if two had lived"
33111 "together for seven years, they were considered man and wife, even"
33111 "without the preliminaries of a formal marriage. Chasteness of the girls"
33111 "before marriage was by no means strictly observed, nor was it required."
33111 "The regulations regarding this subject are of an extremely frivolous"
33111 "nature and in contradiction with civilized morals. When a woman"
33111 "committed adultery, her husband had a right to beat her--this was one of"
33111 "three cases when he could do so without incurring a penalty--but after"
33111 "that he could not demand any other satisfaction, for \"the same crime"
33111 "shall either be atoned for or avenged, but not both.\" The reasons that"
33111 "entitled a woman to a divorce without curtailing her claims to a fair"
33111 "settlement were of a very diverse nature: bad breath of the man was"
33111 "sufficient. The ransom to be paid to the chief or king for the right of"
33111 "the first night (gobr merch, hence the medieval name marcheta, French"
33111 "marquette) plays a conspicuous part in the code of laws. The women had"
33111 "the right to vote in the public meetings. Add to this that similar"
33111 "conditions are vouched for in Ireland; that marriage on time was also"
33111 "quite the custom there, and that the women were assured of liberal and"
33111 "well defined privileges in case of divorce, even to the point of"
33111 "remuneration for domestic services; that a \"first wife\" existed by the"
33111 "side of others, and that legal and illegal children without distinction"
33111 "received a share of their deceased parent's property--and we have a"
33111 "picture of the pairing family among the Celts. The marriage laws of the"

33111 "the soil had been the collective property of the gens or the clan,"

33111 "new assignment of the whole gentile territory to the rest of the"
33111 "household. This division of land probably took place according to such"
33111 "rules as were observed in Germany. Until about fifty years ago, village"
33111 "marks were quite frequent, and some of these so-called rundales may be"
33111 "found to this day. The farmers of a rundale, individual tenants on the"
33111 "soil that once was the collective property of the gens, but had been"
33111 "confiscated by the English conquerors, each pay the rent for his"
33111 "respective parcel. But they all combine their lands and parcel it off"

33111 "the German river Mosel, are cultivated collectively and their yield is"
33111 "divided into shares. Marshland and pastures are used in common. Fifty"
33111 "years ago, new divisions were still made occasionally, sometimes"

33111 "the Hochwald. The gens also survives in the \"factions.\" The Irish"
33111 "farmers often form parties that seem to be founded on absolutely"

33111 "found nothing to do in his neighborhood, he marched his troops to other"
33111 "countries, where a prospect of war and booty allured him. The German"
33111 "auxiliaries, many of whom fought under the Roman standard even against"
33111 "Germans, had been largely recruited among such followings. They"
33111 "represent the first germs of the \"Landsknecht\" profession, the shame and"
33111 "curse of the Germans. After the conquest of the Roman empire, these"
33111 "retainers of kings together with the unfree Roman courtiers formed the"
33111 "other half of the nobility of later days."

33111 "In general, then, the German tribes combined into nations had the same"
33111 "constitution that had developed among the Greeks of the heroic era and"
33111 "the Romans at the time of the so-called kings: public meetings, councils"
33111 "of gentile chiefs and military leaders who coveted actual royal power."
33111 "It was the highest constitution which the gentile order could produce;"
33111 "it was the standard constitution of the higher stage of barbarism. If"

33111 "According to Tacitus the German nation was very strong in numbers. An"
33111 "approximate idea of the strength of individual German nations is given"
33111 "by Caesar. He states that the number of Usipetans and Tencterans who"
33111 "crossed over to the left bank of the Rhine amounted to 180,000,"
33111 "including women and children. About 100,000[30] members to a single"
33111 "nation is considerably more than e. g. the Iroquois numbered in their"
33111 "prime, when 20,000 of them became the terror of the whole country, from"
33111 "the Great Lakes to the Ohio and Potomac. If we attempt to place the"
33111 "better known nations of the Rhine country by the help of historical"
33111 "reports, we find that a single nation occupies on the map the average"
33111 "area of a Prussian government district, about 10,000 square"
33111 "kilometers[31] or 182 German geographical square miles.[32] The Germania"
33111 "Magna of the Romans, reaching to the Vistula, comprised about 500,000"
33111 "square kilometers. Counting an average of 100,000 for any single"
33111 "nation, the total population of Germania Magna would have amounted to"
33111 "five millions. This is a rather high figure for a barbarian group of"
33111 "nations, although 10 inhabitants to the square kilometer or 550 to the"
33111 "geographical square mile is very little when compared to present"
33111 "conditions. But this does not include the whole number of Germans then"
33111 "living. We know that German nations of the Gothic race, Bastarnians,"
33111 "Peukinians and others, lived all along the Carpathian mountains away"
33111 "down to the mouth of the Danube. They were so numerous that Pliny"
33111 "designated them as the fifth main division of the Germans. As much as"
33111 "180 years B. C. they were mercenaries of the Macedonian King Perseus,"
33111 "and during the first years of Augustus they were still pushing their way"
33111 "as far as the vicinity of Adrianople. Assuming them to have been one"
33111 "million strong we find that at least six millions was the probable"
33111 "population of Germany at the beginning of the Christian era."
33111 ""
33111 "After the final settlement in Germany, the population must have grown"
33111 "with increasing rapidity. The industrial progress mentioned above would"
33111 "be sufficient to prove it. The objects found in the bogs of Sleswick, to"
33111 "judge by the Roman coins found with them, are from the third century."
33111 "Hence at that time the metal and textile industry was already well"
33111 "developed on the Baltic, a lively traffic with the Roman empire was"
33111 "carried on, and the wealthier class enjoyed a certain luxury--all of"
33111 "which indicates that the population had increased. But at the same time"
33111 "the general war of aggression against the Romans commenced along the"
33111 "whole line of the Rhine, of the Roman wall and of the Danube, a line"
33111 "stretching from the North Sea to the Black Sea. This is another proof of"
33111 "the ever growing outward pressure of the population. During the struggle"
33111 "which lasted three centuries, the whole main body of the Gothic"
33111 "nations, with the exception of the Scandinavian Goths and the"
33111 "Burgundians, marched to the Southeast and formed the left wing of the"
33111 "long line of attack. The High Germans (Herminonians) on the Upper Danube"
33111 "fought in the center, and the Iskaevonians on the Rhine, now called"
33111 "Franks, advanced on the right wing. The conquest of Brittany fell to the"
33111 "lot of the Ingaevonians.[33] At the end of the fifth century, the"
33111 "exhausted, bloodless, and helpless Roman empire lay open to the Germans."

33111 "In former chapters we stood at the cradle of antique Greek and Roman"
33111 "civilization. Now we are standing at its grave. The equalizing plane of"
33111 "Roman world power had been gliding for centuries over all the"
33111 "Mediterranean countries. Where the Greek language did not offer any"
33111 "resistance, all national idioms had been crushed by a corrupted Latin."
33111 "There were no longer any distinctions of nationality, no more Gauls,"
33111 "Iberians, Ligurians, Noricans; they had all become Romans. Roman"
33111 "administration and Roman law had everywhere dissolved the old gentile"
33111 "bodies and thus crushed the last remnant of local and national"
33111 "independence. The new type of Romans offered no compensation for this"
33111 "loss, for it did not express any nationality, but only the lack of a"
33111 "nationality. The elements for the formation of new nations were present"
33111 "everywhere. The Latin dialects of the different provinces differentiated"
33111 "more and more. But the natural boundaries that had once made Italy,"
33111 "Gaul, Spain, Africa independent territories, were still present and made"
33111 "themselves felt. Yet there was no strength anywhere for combining these"
33111 "elements into new nations. Nowhere was there the least trace of any"
33111 "capacity for development, nor any power of resistance, much less any"
33111 "creative power. The immense human throng of that enormous territory was"
33111 "held together by one bond alone: the Roman state. But this state had in"
33111 "time become the worst enemy and oppressor of its subjects. The provinces"
33111 "had ruined Rome. It had become a provincial town like all others,"
33111 "privileged, but no longer ruling, no longer the center of the world"
33111 "empire, no longer even the seat of the emperors and subregents who lived"
33111 "in Constantinople, Treves and Milan. The Roman state had become an"
33111 "immense complicated machine, designed exclusively for the exploitation"
33111 "of its subjects. Taxes, state imposts and tithes of all sorts drove the"
33111 "mass of the people deeper and deeper into poverty. By the blackmailing"
33111 "practices of the regents, tax collectors and soldiers, the pressure was"
33111 "increased to such a point that it became insupportable. This was the"
33111 "outcome of Rome's world power. The right of the state to existence was"
33111 "founded on the preservation of order in the interior and the protection"
33111 "against the barbarians outside. But this order was worse than the most"
33111 "disgusting disorder, and the barbarians against whom the state pretended"
33111 "to protect its citizens, were hailed by them as saviors."
33111 ""
33111 "The condition of society was no less desperate. During the last years of"
33111 "the republic, the Roman rulers had already contrived the pitiless"
33111 "exploitation of the conquered provinces. The emperors had not abolished,"
33111 "but organized this exploitation. The more the empire fell to pieces, the"
33111 "higher rose the taxes and tithes, and the more shamelessly did the"
33111 "officials rob and blackmail. Commerce and industry had never been a"
33111 "strong point of the domineering Romans. Only in usury they had excelled"
33111 "all other nations before and after them. What commerce had managed to"
33111 "exist, had been ruined by official extortion. Only in the East, in the"
33111 "Grecian part of the empire, some commerce still vegetated, but this is"
33111 "outside of the scope of our study. Universal reduction to poverty,"
33111 "decrease of traffic, of handicrafts, of art, of population, decay of the"
33111 "towns, return of agriculture to a lower stage--that had been the final"
33111 "result of Roman world supremacy."
33111 ""
33111 "But now agriculture, the most prominent branch of production in the"
33111 "whole Old World, was again supreme, and more than ever. In Italy, the"
33111 "immense estates (latifundiae) that comprised nearly the whole country"
33111 "since the end of the republic, had been utilized in two ways: either as"
33111 "pastures on which the population had been replaced by sheep and oxen,"
33111 "the care of which required only a few slaves; or as country seats, on"
33111 "which masses of slaves carried on horticulture on a large scale, partly"
33111 "for the luxury of the owner, partly for sale on the markets of the"
33111 "towns. The great pastures had been preserved and even extended in"
33111 "certain parts. But the country seats and their horticulture had gone to"
33111 "ruin through the impoverishment of their owners and the decay of the"
33111 "towns. Latifundian economy based on slave labor was no longer"
33111 "profitable; but in its time it had been the only possible form of"
33111 "agriculture on a large scale. Now, however, small production had again"
33111 "become the only lucrative form. One country seat after the other was"
33111 "parceled and leased in small lots to hereditary tenants who paid a fixed"
33111 "rent, or to partiarii, more administrators than tenants who received"
33111 "one-sixth or even only one-ninth of a year's product in remuneration for"
33111 "their work. But these little lots were principally disposed of to"
33111 "colonists who paid a fixed sum annually and could be transferred by sale"
33111 "together with their lots. Although no slaves, still these colonists"
33111 "were not free; they could not marry free citizens, and marriages with"
33111 "members of their own class were not regarded as valid, but as mere"
33111 "concubinages like those of the slaves. The colonists were the prototypes"
33111 "of the medieval serfs."
33111 ""
33111 "The ancient slavery had lost its vitality. Neither in the country in"
33111 "large scale agriculture, nor in the manufactories of the towns did it"
33111 "yield any more returns--the market for its products had disappeared. And"
33111 "small scale production and artisanship, to which the gigantic production"
33111 "of the flourishing time of the empire was now reduced, did not leave any"
33111 "room for numerous slaves. Only house and luxury slaves of the rich were"
33111 "still retained by society. But this declining slavery was as yet"
33111 "sufficiently strong to brand productive labor as slave work, as below"
33111 "the dignity of free Romans; and everybody was now a free Roman. An"
33111 "increasing number of superfluous slaves who had become a drug on their"
33111 "owners were dismissed, while on the other hand the number of colonists"
33111 "and of beggared free men (similar to the poor whites in the slave states"
33111 "of America) grew continuously. Christianity is perfectly innocent of"
33111 "this gradual decline of ancient slavery. For it had taken part in the"
33111 "slavery of the Roman empire for centuries. It never prevented the slave"
33111 "trade of Christians later on, neither of the Germans in the North, nor"
33111 "of the Venetians on the Mediterranean, nor the negro traffic of later"
33111 "years.[34] Slavery died, because it did not pay any longer. But it left"
33111 "behind its poisonous sting by branding as ignoble the productive labor"
33111 "of free men. This brought the Roman world into a closed alley from"
33111 "which it could not escape. Slave labor was economically impossible and"
33111 "the labor of free men was under a moral ban. The one could exist no"
33111 "longer, the other could not yet be the fundamental form of social"
33111 "production. There was no other help but a complete revolution."
33111 ""
33111 "The provinces were not any better off. The most complete reports on this"
33111 "subject are from Gaul. By the side of the colonists, free farmers still"
33111 "existed there. In order to protect themselves against the brutal"
33111 "blackmail of the officials, judges and usurers, they frequently placed"
33111 "themselves under the protectorate of a man of influence and power. Not"
33111 "only single individuals did so, but whole communities, so that the"
33111 "emperors of the fourth century often issued decrees prohibiting this"
33111 "practice. But what good did protection do to the clients? The patron"
33111 "imposed the condition that they should transfer the title of their lots"
33111 "to him, and in return he assured them of the free enjoyment of their"
33111 "land for life--a trick which the holy church remembered and freely"
33111 "imitated during the ninth and tenth century, for the greater glory of"
33111 "God. In the fifth century, however, about the year 475, Bishop Salvianus"
33111 "of Marseilles still vehemently denounced such robbery and relates that"
33111 "the methods of the Roman officials and great landlords became so"
33111 "oppressive that many \"Romans\" fled to the districts occupied by the"
33111 "barbarians and feared nothing so much as a return under Roman rule. That"
33111 "poor parents frequently sold their children into slavery, is proved by a"
33111 "law forbidding this practice."

33111 "In return for liberating the Romans from their own state, the barbarians"
33111 "appropriated two-thirds of the entire land and divided it among"
33111 "themselves. The distribution was made by gentile rules. As the number of"
33111 "the conquerors was relatively small, large tracts remained undivided in"
33111 "the possession of the nation, the tribe or the gens. Every gens"
33111 "distributed the land for cultivation and pastures to the individual"
33111 "households by drawing lots. We do not know whether repeated divisions"
33111 "took place at that time. At any rate, this practice was soon discarded"
33111 "in the Roman provinces, and the individual lot became salable private"
33111 "property, a so-called freehold (allodium). Forests and pastures remained"
33111 "undivided for collective use. This use and the mode of cultivating the"
33111 "divided land was regulated by tradition and the will of the community."
33111 "The longer the gens lived in its village, and the better Germans and"
33111 "Romans became amalgamated in the course of time, the more did the"
33111 "character of kinship lose ground before territorial bounds. The gens"
33111 "disappeared in the mark commune, the members of which, however, still"
33111 "exhibited traces of kinship. In the countries where mark communes were"
33111 "still preserved--in the North of France, in England, Germany and"
33111 "Scandinavia--the gentile constitution gradually merged into a local"
33111 "constitution and thus acquired the capacity of being fitted into a"
33111 "state. Nevertheless this local constitution retained some of the"
33111 "primeval democratic character which distinguishes the whole gentile"
33111 "order, and thus preserved a piece of gentilism even in its enforced"
33111 "degeneration of later times. This left a weapon in the hands of the"
33111 "oppressed, ready to be wielded by them even in the present time."

33111 "We know that the rule over subjugated people does not agree with the"
33111 "gentile constitution. Here we have an opportunity to observe this on a"
33111 "large scale. The German nations, masters of the Roman provinces, had to"
33111 "organize their conquests. But they could neither adopt the Romans as a"
33111 "body into their gentes, nor rule them by the help of gentile organs. A"
33111 "substitute for them had to be placed at the head of the Roman"
33111 "administrative bodies that were largely retained in local affairs, and"
33111 "this substitute could only be another state. Hence the organs of the"
33111 "gentile constitution had to become organs of the state, and under the"
33111 "pressure of the moment this took place very rapidly. Now the first"
33111 "representative of the conquering nation was the military leader. The"
33111 "internal and external security of the conquered territory demanded that"
33111 "his power should be strengthened. The moment had arrived for the"
33111 "transition from war leadership to monarchy. And the change took place."

33111 "Take e. g. the realm of the Franks. The victorious Salians had not only"

33111 "all the large tracts that had not been assigned to the more or less"
33111 "small mark communities, especially of all large forest tracts. The first"
33111 "thing which the king of the Franks, now a real monarch, did was to"
33111 "change this national property into royal property, to steal it from the"
33111 "people and to donate or give it in lien to his retainers. This retinue,"
33111 "originally composed of his personal war followers and of the"
33111 "subcommanders of the army, was increased by Romans, i. e., romanized"

33111 "laws of the country, and with the language of Latin literature. But"
33111 "slaves, serfs and freed slaves also became his courtiers. From among all"
33111 "these he chose his favorites. At first they received donations of public"
33111 "land, and later on these benefits were generally conferred for the"

33111 "chiefs, if it had not become obsolete long ago, could not have held any"
33111 "more meetings. It was soon displaced by the standing retinue of the"
33111 "king. A pretense at the old public meeting was still kept up, but it"

33111 "Just as formerly, the Roman farmers during the last period of the"
33111 "republic, so now the free land-owning peasants, the mass of the Frank"
33111 "people, were exhausted and reduced to penury by continual civil feuds"
33111 "and wars of conquest. They who once had formed the whole army and, after"
33111 "the conquest of France, its picked body, were so impoverished at the end"
33111 "of the ninth century that hardly more than every fifth man could go to"
33111 "war. The former army of free peasants, convoked directly by the king,"
33111 "was replaced by an army composed of dependents of the new nobles. Among"
33111 "these servants were also villeins, the descendants of the peasants who"
33111 "had acknowledged no master but the king and a little earlier not even a"
33111 "king. Under Charlemagne's successors the ruin of the Frank peasantry was"
33111 "aggravated by internal wars, weakness of the royal power and"

33111 "too weak to shield them. But they had to pay dearly for this protection."
33111 "Like the Gallic farmers, they had to transfer the titles of their land"
33111 "to their patrons, and received it back from them as tenants in different"
33111 "and varying forms, but always only in consideration of services and"
33111 "tithes. Once driven into this form of dependence, they gradually lost"
33111 "their individual liberty. After a few generations most of them became"
33111 "serfs. How rapidly the free peasants sank from their level is shown by"
33111 "the land records of the abbey Saint Germain des Pres, then near, now in,"
33111 "Paris. On the vast holdings of this abbey in the surrounding country"
33111 "2788 households, nearly all of them Franks with German names, were"
33111 "living at Charlemagne's time; 2080 of them were colonists, 35 lites,[36]"
33111 "220 slaves and only 8 freeholders. The practice of the patrons to demand"
33111 "the transfer of the land titles to themselves and give the former owners"
33111 "the use of the land for life, denounced as ungodly by Salvianus, was now"
33111 "universally practiced by the Church in its dealings with the peasants."
33111 "The compulsory labor that now came more and more into vogue, had been"
33111 "moulded as much after the Roman angariae, compulsory service for the"
33111 "state, as after the services of the German mark men in bridge and road"
33111 "building and other work for common purposes. By all appearances, then,"
33111 "the mass of the population had arrived at the same old goal after four"
33111 "hundred years."
33111 ""
33111 "That proved two things: Firstly, that the social differentiation and the"
33111 "division of property in the sinking Roman empire corresponded perfectly"
33111 "to the contemporaneous stage of production in agriculture and industry,"
33111 "and hence was unavoidable; secondly, that this stage of production had"
33111 "not been essentially altered for better or worse during four hundred"
33111 "years, and therefore had necessarily produced the same division of"
33111 "property and the same classes of population. The town had lost its"
33111 "supremacy over the country during the last centuries of the Roman"
33111 "empire, and had not regained it during the first centuries of German"
33111 "rule. This presupposes a low stage of agriculture and industry. Such a"
33111 "general condition produces of necessity the domination of great"
33111 "proprietors and the dependence of small farmers. How impossible it was"
33111 "to graft either the slave labor of Roman latifundian economy or the"
33111 "compulsory labor of the new large scale production into such a society,"
33111 "is proved by Charlemagne's very extensive experiments with his famous"
33111 "imperial country residences that left hardly a trace. These experiments"
33111 "were continued only by the convents and brought results only for them."
33111 "But the convents were abnormal social institutions, founded on celibacy."
33111 "They could do exceptional work, but they had to remain exceptions"
33111 "themselves for this very reason."
33111 ""
33111 "Yet some progress had been made during these four hundred years."
33111 "Although in the end we find the same main classes as in the beginning,"
33111 "still the human beings that made up these classes had changed. The"
33111 "ancient slavery had disappeared; gone were also the beggared freemen who"
33111 "had despised work as slavish. Between the Roman colonist and the new"
33111 "serf, there had been the free Frank peasant. The \"useless remembrance"
33111 "and the vain feud\" of the decaying Roman nation was dead and gone. The"
33111 "social classes of the ninth century had been formed during the travail"
33111 "of a new civilization, not in the demoralization of a sinking one. The"
33111 "new race, masters and servants, were a race of men as compared to their"
33111 "Roman predecessors. The relation of powerful landlords to serving"
33111 "peasants, which had been the unavoidable result of collapse in the"
33111 "antique world, was for the Franks the point of departure on a new line"
33111 "of development. Moreover, unproductive as these four hundred years may"

33111 "Having observed the dissolution of the gentile order in the three"
33111 "concrete cases of the Greek, Roman, and German nations, we may now"
33111 "investigate in conclusion the general economic conditions that began by"
33111 "undermining the gentile organization of society during the upper stage"
33111 "of barbarism and ended by doing away with it entirely at the advent of"

33111 "can judge from our sources of information, in the lower stage of"
33111 "barbarism. With this stage, then, we begin our investigation."
33111 ""
33111 "In our standard example, the American redskins of that time, we find the"
33111 "gentile constitution fully developed. A tribe had differentiated into"
33111 "several gentes, generally two. Through the increase of the population,"
33111 "these original gentes again divided into several daughter gentes, making"
33111 "the mother gens a phratry. The tribe itself split up into several"
33111 "tribes, in each of which we again meet a large number of representatives"
33111 "of the old gentes. In certain cases a federation united the related"
33111 "tribes. This simple organization fully sufficed for the social"
33111 "conditions out of which it had grown. It was nothing else than the"
33111 "innate, spontaneous expression of those conditions, and it was well"
33111 "calculated to smooth over all internal difficulties that could arise in"
33111 "this social organization. External difficulties were settled by war."
33111 "Such a war could end in the annihilation of a tribe, but never in its"
33111 "subjugation. It is the grandeur and at the same time the limitation of"
33111 "the gentile order that it has no room either for masters or servants."
33111 "There were as yet no distinctions between rights and duties. The"
33111 "question whether he had a right to take part in public affairs, to"
33111 "practice blood revenge or to demand atonement for injuries would have"
33111 "appeared as absurd to an Indian, as the question whether it was his duty"
33111 "to eat, sleep, and hunt. Nor could any division of a tribe or gens into"
33111 "different classes take place. This leads us to the investigation of the"
33111 "economic basis of those conditions."
33111 ""
33111 "The population was very small in numbers. It was collected only on the"
33111 "territory of the tribe. Next to this territory was the hunting ground"
33111 "surrounding it in a wide circle. A neutral forest formed the line of"
33111 "demarcation from other tribes. The division of labor was quite"
33111 "primitive. The work was simply divided between the two sexes. The men"
33111 "went to war, hunted, fished, provided the raw material for food and the"
33111 "tools necessary for these pursuits. The women cared for the house, and"
33111 "prepared food and clothing; they cooked, weaved and sewed. Each sex was"
33111 "master of its own field of activity; the men in the forest, the women in"
33111 "the house. Each sex also owned the tools made and used by it; the men"
33111 "were the owners of the weapons, of the hunting and fishing tackle, the"
33111 "women of the household goods and utensils. The household was"
33111 "communistic, comprising several, and often many, families.[37] Whatever"
33111 "was produced and used collectively, was regarded as common property: the"
33111 "house, the garden, the long boat. Here, and only here, then, do we find"
33111 "the \"self-earned property\" which jurists and economists have falsely"
33111 "attributed to civilized society, the last deceptive pretext of legality"
33111 "on which modern capitalist property is leaning."
33111 ""
33111 "But humanity did not everywhere remain in this stage. In Asia they found"
33111 "animals that could be tamed and propagated in captivity. The wild"
33111 "buffalo cow had to be hunted down; the tame cow gave birth to a calf"
33111 "once a year, and also furnished milk. Some of the most advanced"
33111 "tribes--Aryans, Semites, perhaps also Turanians--devoted themselves"
33111 "mainly to taming, and later to raising and tending, domestic animals."
33111 "The segregation of cattle raising tribes from the rest of the barbarians"
33111 "constitutes the first great division of social labor. These stock"
33111 "raising tribes did not only produce more articles of food than the rest"
33111 "of the barbarians, but also different kinds of products. They were ahead"
33111 "of the others by having at their disposal not alone milk, milk products,"
33111 "and a greater abundance of meat, but also skins, wool, goat's hair, and"
33111 "the spun and woven goods which the growing abundance of the raw material"
33111 "brought into common use. This for the first time made a regular exchange"
33111 "of products possible. In former stages, exchange could only take place"
33111 "occasionally, and an exceptional ability in manufacturing weapons and"
33111 "tools may have led to a transient division of labor. For example,"
33111 "unquestionable remains of workshops for stone implements of the"
33111 "neolithic period have been found in many places. The artists who"
33111 "developed their ability in those shops, most probably worked for the"
33111 "collectivity, as did the artisans of the Indian gentile order. At any"
33111 "rate, no other exchange than that within the tribe could exist in that"
33111 "stage, and even that was an exception. But after the segregation of the"
33111 "stock raising tribes we find all the conditions favorable to an exchange"
33111 "between groups of different tribes, and to a further development of this"
33111 "mode of trading into a fixed institution. Originally, tribe exchanged"
33111 "with tribe through the agency of their tribal heads. But when the herds"
33111 "drifted into the hands of private individuals, then the exchange between"
33111 "individuals prevailed more and more, until it became the established"
33111 "form. The principal article of exchange which the stock raising tribes"
33111 "offered to their neighbors was in the form of domestic animals. Cattle"
33111 "became the favorite commodity by which all other commodities were"
33111 "measured in exchange. In short, cattle assumed the functions of money"
33111 "and served in this capacity as early as that stage. With such necessity"
33111 "and rapidity was the demand for a money commodity developed at the very"
33111 "beginning of the exchange of commodities."
33111 ""
33111 "Horticulture, probably unknown to the Asiatic barbarians of the lower"
33111 "stage, arose not later than the middle stage of barbarism, as the"
33111 "forerunner of agriculture. The climate of the Turanian Highland does not"
33111 "admit of a nomadic life without a supply of stock feed for the long and"
33111 "hard winter. Hence the cultivation of meadows and grain was"
33111 "indispensable. The same is true of the steppes north of the Black Sea."
33111 "Once grain had been grown for cattle, it soon became human food. The"
33111 "cultivated land belonged as yet to the tribe and was assigned first to"
33111 "the gens, which in its turn distributed it to the households, and"
33111 "finally to individuals; always for use only, not for possession. The"
33111 "users may have had certain claims to the land, but that was all."
33111 ""
33111 "Two of the industrial acquisitions of this stage are especially"
33111 "important. The first is the weaving loom, the second the melting of"
33111 "metal ore and the use of metals in manufacture. Copper, tin, and their"
33111 "alloy, bronze, were the most essential of them. Bronze furnished tools"
33111 "and weapons, but could not displace stone implements. Only iron could"
33111 "have done that, but the production of iron was as yet unknown. Gold and"
33111 "silver were already used for ornament and decoration, and must have been"
33111 "far more precious than copper and bronze."
33111 ""
33111 "The increase of production in all branches--stock raising, agriculture,"
33111 "domestic handicrafts--enabled human labor power to produce more than was"
33111 "necessary for its maintenance. It increased at the same time the amount"
33111 "of daily work that fell to the lot of every member of a gens, a"
33111 "household, or a single family. The addition of more labor power became"
33111 "desirable. It was furnished by war; the captured enemies were"
33111 "transformed into slaves. Under the given historical conditions, the"
33111 "first great division of social labor, by increasing the productivity of"
33111 "labor, adding to the wealth, and enlarging the field of productive"
33111 "activity, necessarily carried slavery in its wake. Out of the first"
33111 "great division of social labor arose the first great division of society"
33111 "into two classes: masters and servants, exploiters and exploited."
33111 ""
33111 "How and when the herds were transferred from the collective ownership of"
33111 "the tribe or gens to the proprietorship of the heads of the families, is"
33111 "not known to us. But it must have been practically accomplished in this"
33111 "stage. The herds and the other new objects of wealth brought about a"
33111 "revolution in the family. Procuring the means of existence had always"
33111 "been the man's business. The tools of production were manufactured and"
33111 "owned by him. The herds were the new tools of production, and their"
33111 "taming and tending was his work. Hence he owned the cattle and the"
33111 "commodities and slaves obtained in exchange for them. All the surplus"
33111 "now resulting from production fell to the share of the man. The woman"
33111 "shared in its fruition, but she could not claim its ownership. The"
33111 "\"savage\" warrior and hunter had been content to occupy the second place"
33111 "in the house, to give precedence to the woman. The \"gentler\" shepherd,"
33111 "standing on his wealth, assumed the first place and forced the woman"
33111 "back into the second place. And she had no occasion to complain. The"
33111 "division of labor in the family had regulated the distribution of"
33111 "property between man and wife. This division of labor remained"
33111 "unchanged. Yet the former domestic relation was now reversed, simply"
33111 "because the division of labor outside of the family had been altered."
33111 "The same cause that once had secured the supremacy in the house for"
33111 "women, viz., the confining of women's activity to domestic labor, now"
33111 "assured the supremacy of the men in the households. The domestic labor"
33111 "of women was considered insignificant in comparison to men's work for a"
33111 "living. The latter was everything, the former a negligible quantity. At"
33111 "this early stage we can already see that the emancipation of women and"
33111 "their equality with men are impossible and remain so, as long as women"
33111 "are excluded from social production and restricted to domestic labor."
33111 "The emancipation of women becomes feasible only then when women are"
33111 "enabled to take part extensively in social production, and when domestic"
33111 "duties require their attention in a minor degree. This state of things"
33111 "was brought about by the modern great industries, which not only admit"
33111 "of women's liberal participation in production, but actually call for it"
33111 "and, besides, endeavor to transform domestic work also into a public"
33111 "industry."
33111 ""
33111 "Man's advent to practical supremacy in the household marked the removal"
33111 "of the last barrier to his universal supremacy. His unlimited rule was"
33111 "emphasized and endowed with continuity by the downfall of matriarchy,"
33111 "the introduction of patriarchy, and the gradual transition from the"
33111 "pairing family to the monogamic family. This made a breach in the old"
33111 "gentile order. The monogamic family became a power and lifted a"
33111 "threatening hand against the gens."
33111 ""
33111 "The next step brings us to the upper stage of barbarism, that period in"
33111 "which all nations of civilization go through their heroic era. It is the"
33111 "time of the iron sword, but also of the iron plow share and axe. The"
33111 "iron had become the servant of man. It is the last and most important of"
33111 "all raw products that play a revolutionary role in history; the last--if"
33111 "we except the potato."
33111 ""
33111 "Iron brought about agriculture on a larger scale and the clearing of"
33111 "extensive forest tracts for cultivation. It gave to the craftsman a tool"
33111 "of such hardness and sharpness that no stone, no other known metal,"
33111 "could withstand it. All this came about gradually. The first iron was"
33111 "often softer than bronze. Therefore stone implements disappeared very"
33111 "slowly. Not only in the Hildebrand Song, but also at Hastings in 1066,"
33111 "stone axes were still used in fighting. But progress was now"
33111 "irresistible, less interrupted and more rapid. The town, inclosing"
33111 "houses of stone or tiles within its turreted and crested stone walls,"
33111 "became the central seat of the tribe or federation of tribes. It showed"
33111 "an astounding progress of architecture, but also an increase of danger"
33111 "and of the demand for protection. Wealth increased rapidly, but it was"
33111 "the wealth of private individuals. Weaving, metal work and other more"
33111 "and more differentiating industries developed an increasing variety and"
33111 "display of art in production. Agriculture furnished not alone grain,"
33111 "peas, beans and fruit, but also oil and wine, the preparation of which"
33111 "had now been learned. Such a diversity of action could not be displayed"
33111 "by any single individual. The second great division of labor took place:"
33111 "handicrafts separated from agriculture. The growing intensity of"
33111 "production and the increased productivity enhanced the value of human"
33111 "labor power. Slavery, which had been a rising and sporadic factor in the"
33111 "preceding stage, now became an essential part of the social system. The"
33111 "slaves ceased to be simple assistants. They were now driven in scores to"
33111 "the work in the fields and shops. The division of production into two"
33111 "great branches, agriculture and handicrafts, gave rise to production for"
33111 "exchange, the production of commodities. Trade arose at the same time,"
33111 "not only in the interior and on the tribal boundaries, but also in the"
33111 "form of maritime exchange. All this was as yet in a very undeveloped"
33111 "state. The precious metals gained preference as a universal money"
33111 "commodity, but still uncoined and exchanged merely by dead weight."
33111 ""

33111 "little importance, such as religious festivals, were still observed in"
33111 "an indifferent way. Beside the wants and interests for the care of which"
33111 "the gentile organs were appointed and fitted, new wants and interests"
33111 "had arisen from the revolution of the conditions of existence and the"

33111 "production of commodities combining them, reach their highest"
33111 "development and revolutionize the whole society."
33111 ""
33111 "The production of all former stages of society was mainly collective,"
33111 "and consumption was carried on by direct division of products within"
33111 "more or less small communes. This collective production was confined"
33111 "within the narrowest limits. But it implied the control of production"
33111 "and of the products by the producers. They knew what became of their"
33111 "product: it did not leave their hands until it was consumed by them. As"
33111 "long as production moved on this basis, it could not grow beyond the"
33111 "control of the producers, and it could not create any strange ghostly"
33111 "forces against them. Under civilization, however, this is the inevitable"
33111 "rule."
33111 ""
33111 "Into the simple process of production, the division of labor was"
33111 "gradually interpolated. It undermined the communism of production and"
33111 "consumption, it made the appropriation of products by single individuals"
33111 "the prevailing rule, and thus introduced the exchange between"
33111 "individuals, in the manner mentioned above. Gradually, the production of"
33111 "commodities became the rule."
33111 ""
33111 "This mode of production for exchange, not for home consumption,"
33111 "necessarily passes the products on from hand to hand. The producer gives"
33111 "his product away in exchange. He does no longer know what becomes of it."
33111 "With the advent of money and of the trader who steps in as a middleman"
33111 "between the producers, the process of exchange becomes still more"
33111 "complicated. The fate of the products becomes still more uncertain. The"
33111 "number of merchants is great and one does not know what the other is"
33111 "doing. The products now pass not only from hand to hand, but also from"
33111 "market to market. The producers have lost the control of the aggregate"
33111 "production in their sphere of life, and the merchants have not yet"
33111 "acquired this control. Products and production become the victims of"
33111 "chance. But chance is only one pole of an interrelation, the other pole"
33111 "of which is called necessity. In nature, where chance seems to reign"
33111 "also, we have long ago demonstrated the innate necessity and law that"
33111 "determines the course of chance on every line. But what is true of"
33111 "nature, holds also good of society. Whenever a social function or a"
33111 "series of social processes become too powerful for the control of man,"
33111 "whenever they grow beyond the grasp of man and seem to be left to mere"
33111 "chance, then the peculiar and innate laws of such processes shape the"
33111 "course of chance with increased elementary necessity. Such laws also"
33111 "control the vicissitudes of the production and exchange of commodities."
33111 "For the individual producer and exchanger, these laws are strange, and"
33111 "often unknown, forces, the nature of which must be laboriously"
33111 "investigated and ascertained. These economic laws of production are"
33111 "modified by the different stages of this form of production. But"
33111 "generally speaking, the entire period of civilization is dominated by"
33111 "these laws. To this day, the product controls the producer. To this day,"
33111 "the aggregate production of society is managed, not on a uniform plan,"
33111 "but by blind laws, that rule with elementary force and find their final"
33111 "expression in the storms of periodical commercial crises."
33111 ""
33111 "We have seen that human labor power is enabled at a very early stage of"
33111 "production to produce considerably more than is needed to maintain the"
33111 "producer. We have found that this stage coincided in general with the"
33111 "first appearance of the division of labor and of exchange between"
33111 "individuals. Now, it was not long before the great truth was discovered"
33111 "that man may himself be a commodity, and that human labor power may be"
33111 "exchanged and exploited by transforming a man into a slave. Hardly had"
33111 "exchange between men been established, when men themselves were also"
33111 "exchanged. The active asset became a passive liability, whether man"
33111 "wanted it or not."
33111 ""
33111 "Slavery, which reaches its highest development in civilization,"
33111 "introduced the first great division of an exploited and an exploiting"
33111 "class into society. This division continued during the whole period of"
33111 "civilization. Slavery is the first form of exploitation, characteristic"
33111 "of the antique world. Then followed feudalism in the middle ages, and"
33111 "wage labor in recent times. These are the three great forms of"
33111 "servitude, characteristic of the three great epochs of civilization."
33111 "Their invariable mark is either open or, in modern times, disguised"
33111 "slavery."
33111 ""
33111 "The stage of commodity production introducing civilization is marked"
33111 "economically by the introduction of (1) metal coins and, thus, of money"
33111 "as capital, of interest, and of usury; (2) merchants as middlemen"
33111 "between producers; (3) private property and mortgage; (4) slave labor as"
33111 "the prevailing form of production. The form of the family corresponding"
33111 "to civilization and becoming its pronounced custom is monogamy, the"
33111 "supremacy of man over woman, and the monogamous family as the economic"
33111 "unit of society. The aggregation of civilized society is the state,"
33111 "which throughout all typical periods is the state of the ruling class,"
33111 "and in all cases mainly a machine for controlling the oppressed and"
33111 "exploited class. Civilization is furthermore characterized on one side"
33111 "by the permanent introduction of the contrast between city and country"
33111 "as the basis of the entire division of social labor; on the other side"
33111 "by the introduction of the testament by which the property holder is"
33111 "enabled to dispose of his property beyond the hour of his death. This"
33111 "institution is a direct blow at the gentile constitution, and was"
33111 "unknown in Athens until the time of Solon. In Rome it was introduced"
33111 "very early, but we do not know when.[45] In Germany it was originated by"
33111 "the priests in order that the honest German might bequeath his property"
33111 "to the church without any interference."
33111 ""
33111 "With this fundamental constitution, civilization had accomplished things"
33111 "for which the old gentile society was no match whatever. But these"
33111 "exploits were accomplished by playing on the most sordid passions and"
33111 "instincts of man, and by developing them at the expense of all his other"
33111 "gifts. Barefaced covetousness was the moving spirit of civilization from"
33111 "its first dawn to the present day; wealth, and again wealth, and for the"
33111 "third time wealth; wealth, not of society, but of the puny individual,"
33111 "was its only and final aim. If nevertheless the advanced development of"
33111 "science, and at repeated times the highest flower of art, fell into its"
33111 "lap, this was only due to the fact that without them the highest"
33111 "emoluments of modern wealth would have been missing. Exploitation of one"
33111 "class by another being the basis of civilization, its whole development"
33111 "involves a continual contradiction. Every progress of production is at"
33111 "the same time a retrogression in the condition of the oppressed class,"
33111 "that is of the great majority. Every benefit for one class is"
33111 "necessarily an evil for the other, every new emancipation of one class a"
33111 "new oppression for the other. The most drastic proof of this is"
33111 "furnished by the introduction of machinery, the effects of which are"
33111 "well known to-day. And while there is hardly any distinction between"
33111 "rights and duties among barbarians, as we have seen, civilization makes"
33111 "the difference between these two plain even to the dullest mind. For now"
33111 "one class has nearly all the rights, the other class nearly all the"
33111 "duties."
33111 ""
33111 "But this is not admitted. What is good for the ruling class, is alleged"
33111 "to be good for the whole of society with which the ruling class"
33111 "identifies itself. The more civilization advances, the more it is found"
33111 "to cover with the cloak of charity the evils necessarily created by it,"
33111 "to excuse them or to deny their existence, in short to introduce a"
33111 "conventional hypocrisy that culminates in the declaration: The"
33111 "exploitation of the oppressed class is carried on by the exploiting"
33111 "class solely in the interest of the exploited class itself. And if the"
33111 "latter does not recognize this, but even becomes rebellious, it is"
33111 "simply the worst ingratitude to its benefactors, the exploiters.[46]"

33111 "\"Since the advent of civilization, the outgrowth of property has been so"
